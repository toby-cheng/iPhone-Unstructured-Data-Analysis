"1","Solid Update & Great Performing Camera","Having owned my old iPhone 7 Plus for 3 years but still running great, I hadn’t thought much about buying another phone until the 11 Pro was announced. I liked what Apple offered on it and made the investment. I wasn’t disappointed and even surprised in other features like the fact it can use AT&Ts 5GE network which isn’t real 5G but LTE using multiple antennas to double up the bandwidth. Cool! As for the camera and battery, the reason I bought it, didn’t disappoint me. Taking pics is now a lot more powerful and faster yet keeps it simple and battery life helps enjoy it for longer as it’s the best I’ve ever had on any smartphone. I’ve been averaging about 15 hours of heavy usage in the last couple of days. Everything from enjoying music and videos, texting, phones calls, IG & Snapchat. Even did some video editing after capturing some video and taking pictures. I’m sure I can improve the life once the novelty of it goes away and I don’t turn it on unnecessarily. LoL As always its way faster and the screen looks amazing in any light. Though a little heavier than any phone I’ve used, the Midnight Green looks awesome in my opinion. As to why I like using an iPhone, I know there are lots of choices running Android but the simplicity of taking pics and video, editing them and syncing them across my devices and posting them while on the move are key for me. So, that’s my take on the iPhone 11 Pro Max after the last 4 days.",5,2019-09-23 21:15:00
"2","Pretty impressive!","I waited to upgrade my 8 plus even though i could have done so when the 11 was out. Watched alot of reviews  and finally upgraded about 2 weeks ago and oh boy iam impressed with the improvement on the camera department!although its not like day and night different! I could care less about other features tbh, to me the best camera is the one that you always have in your pocket. Thats why i upgraded and it was because i was due to upgrade. If i wasnt id rather wait untill my 8 plus paid off and skip this gen of iphone and wait for the 12 or something. The camera is worth the upgrade from my 8 plus but still i dont think it deserves the ridiculous 1250 dollar price tag. If you have the 8 plus or the x series and they are not paid off yet, trust me you can wait but if you want to be that guy/girl who always wants to have the latest and the greatest from apple and have tons of money to burn, well no one can stop you doesnt matter how many honest reviews you have read or watch.",5,2019-10-31 18:32:00
"3","Love it","I wasn’t gonna upgrade from the X but the screen broke and to fix it it was gonna cost $300 which is more than what I needed to pay to upgrade so I did it lol. The camera is awesome and the battery life is great. Fast charging is a complete game changing too. I know people will say Samsung is better but for me with everything I own is Apple this phone is perfect for me and I like the iOS VS android so IMO if you’re looking for a new phone with a great camera get this one.",5,2019-10-18 18:23:00
"4","Wow! Just wow!","Ok, so I went from the X to this phone and was not sure if I’d see a real difference. But you can tell! I got the Max and while it does feel slightly larger it is not bad at all. My two big things I love is the camera at night and the battery life. 

I did multiple side by side pictures at night using the wife’s iPhone X and the 11. Noticeable difference. Some of the night pictures come out a little yellowish but it is still better than getting nothing like I was before. The two pictures below were in different lighting environments and they both came out great. The one of the vehicles was taken at about 4am with no lights on whatsoever. 

Battery life is great and lasts all day. Need I say more?!",5,2019-10-17 16:39:00
"5","What a camera!","I’ve never seen night photos on a cellphone like this one. Completely unreal. Also the brightness and resolution of the screen is mesmerizing.",5,2019-09-27 16:26:00
"6","amazing camera and improved sound quality","The sound quality is far improved and I am still learning all the capabilities of the camera. It is far more durable than it looks. Nice job Apple!",5,2019-10-05 07:47:00
"7","Very happy.","This phone does everything. Best cameras and best everything.",5,2019-10-25 18:26:00
"8","Love it.","Best iPhone ever! Elegant and functionally great. Resolution superb and battery life significant better. Ios13 makes puts me into the star week zone.",5,2019-09-27 15:17:00
"9","Love the new camera!","I just purchased the new iPhone 11 Pro Max a week ago, I have just scratched the surface of learning everything this iPhone is capable of....but I love it already! The camera is phenomenal, I love the design and the 6.8” screen size.",5,2019-09-28 08:16:00
"10","I always been a apple head but i just love ever","This phone is beautiful, i have 2 max pros and 1 XSMax it’s a big upgrade for me even if nothing changed. Lol but seriously it’s a cool phone.",5,2019-09-27 15:44:00
"11","I went max and it is beautiful","Received mine yesterday and after been using apple products for over 10 years, I must say this one is the best so far. The correct size, the cameras are superb and feels good in the hand. Waiting for xmas to get the apple watch 5.",5,2019-09-24 05:33:00
"12","LOVE IT SO FAR","Upgraded from an xs max and I’m in love with it so far !",5,2019-09-21 10:29:00
"13","iPhone 11 Pro Max Extreme lens flare issues","I'm having extreme lens flare issues and any little light situation, I can't get this resolved. I've tried Apple, they replace my phone with refurbished one, then they replace my lenses but still I'm experiencing the following;

"14","11pro max","Love the bigger screen. The camera is great, still learning. 
The battery is much improved.",5,2019-12-27 19:26:00
"15","Amazing Device!!","First thing: the camera is Amazing! Specially in portrait mode creates a beautiful shallow background isolating the subject nicely and actually looks natural! Screen resolution is incredible for watching movies that have night scenes the darks and shadows are rich with lots of contrast ! I upgraded from the 6s plus that was also an amazing phone but the 11 pro blew me away!",5,2019-11-24 09:11:00
"16","Best IPhone Yet","Remarkable features and sleek design with a powerful clear camera. The balance and weight of the device is fundamentally sound. Truly the fastest processor on any iPhone to date. Worth the buy/upgrade.",5,2019-12-14 12:30:00
"17","Amazing Camera & Battery","So, at this point if you are not familiar with iOS and what iPhones are all about here comes a short summary. Apple iPhones are normally great hardware, build quality, and easy UI. Unlike Android, normally you don’t hear spec sheets on iPhone. RAM, battery size, processors are usually a mute point because they iPhone run iOS which can’t really compared to Android. Don’t get me wrong I’ve used many, many Android phones (most recently the Samsung Note 10+) and they have some amazing phones, with equally amazing cameras, and features. 

So, what sets this iPhone apart from the ones that have come before, even the XS, is the cameras are a huge step forward, and they battery is hard to kill. Most phones take great photos in optimal lighting conditions. What sets phones apart is how they handle low light, or night photography. Here is where this iPhone really shines. The images that this device is able to capture with little light is amazing. With Deep Fusion around the corner, you will also see an increase in detail in most photos that don’t use the Night shot mode or HDR. The battery holds up amazingly well. Even after a day of heavy usage, screen on over 8 hours I am able to end the day around 20-30% easily. I usually unplug around 6am and plug it back in around 10-11pm. Never do I feel like I need to top off the battery for fear of not making it through the day.

Everything else on the phone is still great, but not what I would consider a huge step up from previous models. Screen looks amazing, super bright in direct sunlight, Speakers are great, sometimes I forgo my Bluetooth speaker and just use the phones speakers. The matte glass back feels great, but most people won’t see it since most cover it up with a case to protect this investment. 

I would definitely recommend this to anyone, especially those already locked in to the Apple ecosystem. Apple’s iOS 13 is great, and offers some great features, but that isn’t specific to this phone so go and upgrade your old device first to see what you are getting here. I am very happy with my upgrade.",5,2019-10-20 14:20:00
"18","Cost to value ratio is closing","I really like this iphone and iOS in general. However, what is up with iphone charging $1100 for 64gb vs Samsung Note 10+ offering 256gb in addition to an SD card option for the same price? Things like this are making me take pause about my decision to stay in the Apple ecosystem. I've had this phone a week and I still can't confirm in my mind if this makes sense, to keep my iphone simply because I want everything to work between my apple watch and my ipad. To make me question things even harder, i can get the Note 10+ with 256gb for $150 less than this iphone. Are the camera's that great that it's worth this price bump? These are the things that keep me up at night until my return period expires then I'm in for the next year at least. Never the less, this phone is pretty great so I'm rating it accordingly. No idea if I'm going to keep it or not yet, though.",4,2019-09-27 15:52:00
"19","THE BATTERY! OH MY! THE CAMERA!","Okay, I'm hearing impaired. I heavily rely on video communication versus voice communication. So I easily drain my battery on my iPhone. But after upgrading to this, you have no idea how thrilled I am to have an iPhone that lasts me from the time I wake up until the time I go to sleep. The battery hasn't gotten low when going to bed. It's so great! When upgrading from iPhone X to iPhone XS Max, I was horrified by the front camera's beautify feature. I take a lot of selfies on X until XS Max, I never took selfie ever again. It was awful not seeing my face naturally because it looks like I'm wearing makeup or own a Samsung phone. However, upgrading to iPhone 11 Pro Max... I was so happy to see that the selfie camera is back to natural like photos. No, beautify garbage.",5,2020-01-14 04:17:00
"20","Great phone!","This is my phone, and it offers significant advantages over our old 6s’s. First, facial recognition has been flawless not only for the phone, but for apps that accept it. It also is much easier to unlock and use (just look at the face of the phone) than finger print recognition. We also like the fact that we can get a charging pad for it, rather than having to plug and unplug a charging wire. The Apple wires are too short, and the longer 3rd-party ones do not hold up, in my experience, with constant use. The wide, normal, and telephoto lenses are a big improvement. The camera also is far more complex and versatile than the one I had on my 6s. I recommend going online for instructional info. The only thing I am still getting accustomed to is not taking screen-shots (pressing volume up button and on/off button simultaneously). I like the space gray.",5,2019-12-31 13:56:00
"21","Amazing!!!!!","So I was content with my iPhone X for years and didn’t see much reason for an upgrade. After seeing what the iPhone 11 Pro Max had to offer I made not only a leap into a newer phone but also my first oversized phone. I love it!
the sound when watching Movies is very immersive completely blew me away for a smartphone!
I have yet to get into all the extra’s but what I have done in the new camera app running the new Tri Cam set up has been nothing short of amazing! Brilliant colors excellent clarity even the less talked about focused audio recording works great when filming your kids riding off on bikes just a little zoom and the sound and image is as if they never left your side. 
Battery life is impressive I forgot to charge over night and managed to make it through the next day of work. 
I have had nothing but fun enjoying my new iPhone Pro Max if you are considering making the switch I say go for it!!!


Ps my only complaint @apple I miss 3D Touch but I have got along without it as well it’s just so hard to say goodbye to yes......3D touch.",5,2019-09-29 22:08:00
"22","Stellar phone","It really is a great phone! Best one yet.
Extremely durable, battery life is AMAZING, and 
Here are some things that I’ve noticed that aren’t necessarily bad, but might bother others:
- while the triple lenses are nice, picture quality still sucks. I will say that wide angle lens is awesome tho.
- night mode in the camera settings cannot stay permanently off. It’s great for light absorption in dark situations (similar to a long shutter speed on a dslr), but waiting 1-3 seconds for the picture to process is quite annoying. Especially when you either wanted a dark picture, or have subjects that can’t sit still. You can tap the night mode icon and slide the timer to off, but this must be done every time it detects inadequate light. 
- it’s heavy! Maybe because I came from the 8 & X, but still, for a phone, it’s quite the dense rock lol.
- the screen is “tall”; the Max models are larger In general, but compared to previous Plus models that had top & bottom caption-style hardware/home buttons, this one is pretty long compared to its lack of wideness. If you one-hand operate a lot, I’d recommend playing in many different apps to get a feel for how far you’ll have to stretch lol.
- the flashlight gives a pinkish hue.. unimportant I’m sure, but it’s also not as bright. 
Overall a great device and I would absolutely purchase again!",5,2019-11-01 16:19:00
"23","This is a great phone!","I’ve been waiting to see whether I wanted to purchase the 11 pro max or wait for the new 12 to come out. I got the 11 pro max and I don’t regret it. It’s better than the iPhone X that I had because I missed the big screen and the ease of a bigger phone in my hands. I love the midnight green color as well. It’s much more different than the basic colors that have been available in the past. The cameras are ASTOUNDING!!!!!!! This gives me a new reason to take more pictures of myself and my wife when we are out and about.",5,2020-01-31 19:35:00
"24","Apple Is For Winners","“If you’re not first, you’re last” I wanted the best, I wanted to be a winner, so I bought an Apple iPhone. Siri has helped take me to where I am right now. I’m not going to tell you my exact location because then you’ll prolly wanna come and take selfies with MY amazingly awesome iPhone 11pro. Because it takes great selfies and while I consider myself rather dashing at times (I clean up well) I never really considered myself THAT photogenic. That is until this new iPhone. I almost wanna jump out there and call myself an instagram model? Dare to dream? Yes! I know. This phone is THAT awesome!",5,2020-01-04 08:58:00
"25","Just a flawless product again","I got this phone to replace a flawless 2 year old iPhone X, mainly for the larger screen. You can never go wrong with an iPhone. It’s just a very well executed device that will always work. It might not have all the latest features, but at least the features and processes are perfected. I’m really happy with this phone and the screen size is just right; it’s much easier to type on. The speakers are loud, the battery and cameras are amazing, and most importantly it just works.",5,2019-09-22 07:30:00
"26","Superb!","Just Upgraded to this from my iPhone 8 Plus 256gb. I see no difference from the XSmax, but the camera is awesome! I can take great selfies with portrait mode and the wide angle is awesome as well. The main reason I upgraded, really. This gives me an alternative for when I need to leave my Nikon D5600 in the room since it is bulky. Face ID is great. I feel like this phone is easier for me to hold without it slipping. My only issues is that I have to bring the control center down to see the battery percentage and the part that contains the face camera takes up a small portion of the screen. Nothing major.",5,2019-10-04 17:26:00
"27","Pro max 11","Awesome phone love the 3 camera pics well it's my son's phone so he loved it even more.. Thanks",2,2020-01-03 15:54:00
"28","Best Phone Ever!","There’s not really a whole lot you have to say to convince someone that the iPhone 11 Pro Max is the worlds best cellular phone. There’s not really anything bad that I can say about it. The only negative to an $1,100 phone is that it doesn’t come with AirPods and it doesn’t have a USB-C charging port. I bought a wireless charging stand for at home and at work, so it doesn’t really matter a whole lot, but it would have been nice to have a only one charging port for all of my devices (iPhone, iPad, MacBook Pro, etc.)",5,2019-12-22 18:38:00
"29","So Far, Love this phone","First Apple product so it will take some getting used to, but I like the features I see. Facial scanning is a first for me. It really works to unlock your phone. The color (green) is unique and nice. I also got the 256GB storage I wanted by getting it at Best Buy. That one is always sold out everywhere else. Yet to use the camera but looking forward to it.",5,2020-01-24 15:16:00
"30","Brilliant camera, lighting fast, and long battery!","You could not ask for a better combination. Downside Apple released the phone with the new IOS that contained a number of bugs.  To be fair they have already started releasing updates to fix those, but still expected a little more from Apple on a new IOS and phone release.
I got the Pro, while a family member also purchased the regular iPhone.  Both great phones, and really the biggest noticeable difference is the camera, which comes in handy for my job. Zooming in for photos or videos still provides crystal clear images.  I had a chance to the difference in pictures when we recently attended a concert.  With all the lighting effects, the iPhone 11 to good photos, but the Pro, lets just say that I was asked to send all my photos to my family member!",5,2019-10-26 09:54:00
"31","Very happy","This was a must for my daughter,  she gets the newest phone every time  the phone is available for an upgraded as a Christmas gift.  Witch is every other year.  No headaches, no returns during the holidays, it’s a wonderful thing as well as the 11 PRO MAX is I think the best version so far.    I did this with all three kids and my youngest is 19 so you can imagine how many phones I’ve used and purchased.",5,2020-01-10 18:40:00
"32","Top of the line phone won't disappoint","Purchased to have better camera. Camera is awesome and will be using it for video recording.

The face recognition is awesome. The finger scan unlock in the previous version I had didn't work when my fingers were wet. Amazing to not have to do anything but look at it.

The battery has been spectacular.",5,2020-02-03 07:06:00
"33","Apple did it again","I love this phone, I’ve been iPhone user for years and years but the reason I gave 4 star is because the front camera sucks. iPhone 6,7 and 8 had better camera than 11pro and pro max. Overall phone is awesome.",4,2019-10-11 15:20:00
"34","Great phone!","Take everything you thought was good about the last iPhone and make it a little bit better. That’s about it. Well actually, the camera Is quite a bit better!  Other than that, it’s just better all around n every measurable way. Should you buy this if you are currently using a 10s??  Depends on how important the camera is to you. Put it this way- if your on aTT next or whatever program your carrier offers, and your due for an upgrade, YES get it. If you have a xs and it’s paid off, I would say hold on. But if your paying 40 some odd dollars for the Xs every month and you Are due for an upgrade, might as well get the new one.  That’s just my opinion.",5,2019-10-18 19:16:00
"35","The best iPhone so far","I have owned every iPhone release since iPhone 3GS, except for the iPhone 7 and 8 and the iPhone 11 Pro Max has every feature you would want from an iPhone from better battery life to amazing cameras. I upgraded from a iPhone 10s Max and even though the diferrences might seem small they are bigger than what it seems, that is not to say that the iPhone 10s Max was lagging in performance, it was still a good device. Each year Apple releases the best iPhone from thir previous iteration. If you want any of the missing features such as bilateral wireless charging, USB C, different design, then wait for the new iPhone in 2020 or go buy the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+, but if you love using iPhones then this is the one to get.",5,2019-09-28 08:45:00
"36","So far it's a nice phone","I still had an iPhone 7s so it was time for an upgrade. I miss the home button but I'm slowly getting used to the ""swipe up"" feature. And the face recognition is nice. 
I don't do a lot with my phone so I haven't played with all the bells and whistles but it takes great pictures. 
Battery life is decent but not as great as I thought it should be.",5,2020-01-02 08:31:00
"37","Great clarity and impressive speeds","I’ve always had great luck with iPhones. Love the features and design. However, I have had broken screens on the X and now a clear scratch on this new 11 pro max. For the screens to supposedly be so great, I haven’t had much luck.",5,2020-01-31 15:12:00
"38","Big Improvement","Bought this as an upgrade from my iPhone 7 Plus. It was working OK but was out of on board storage. After owning it for less that two weeks I can say that the 11 Pro Max is better in every way. Screen colors, performance, camera, everything. Even the speakerphone is better. The cost was tough to swallow, but I'm very happy with the purchase so far.",5,2019-12-20 20:20:00
"39","A Great update","While some might think the 3 camera setup is not the best design, the new phone is a great improvement.  I love the third lens and the setup.  I don't feel like I'm always getting my fingers in the way and I can see so much more in my photos.  Besides that the screen in the pro series is phenominal and an understated point …. I can easily see everything on the new display even in direct sunlight.  With the X and XS series I used to have to wonder because it wold be darker but this guy can keep up....  Besides all that I am loving the battery saving features of this phone it really is a large improvement with the A13 processor!",5,2019-09-28 06:08:00
"40","Great Phone","I've switched between iPhone and Android often.  I'm really enjoying the 11 Pro Max.  For me personally, I like that it's heavier than past models and a little thicker.  The battery life has been great along with the cameras.    

If you have the X, XR, or XS it's not worth upgrading if you don't use the camera that often.  All of the improvements are great, but not worth upgrading just yet, in my opinion.",5,2019-09-23 16:50:00
"41","Best Buy experience excellent!","We were focused on this phone, and based on previous experiences, decided Best Buy was our best plan. They had what we were looking for in inventory (could see on the website before going), and as always, were met and helped quickly and positively upon arrival. Great experience!",5,2020-01-10 16:22:00
"42","A Much Needed Upgrade","My iPhone X was getting a little slow and glitchy. The 11 Pro is an amazing phone. I love the new frosted look and the new camera system is unbeatable. If you have the XS I would probably wait for the 2020 iPhone, but other than that I'd recommend the upgrade.",5,2019-10-05 10:36:00
"43","Greatest iPhone Yet!","Most reviews I’ve read about the iPhone 11 Pro seem to lean towards it being nearly the same as the iPhone X. While the front may look the same, I’m here to tell you the internal components are where Apple invested their money on this newest version. The new A13 chip is incredibly snappy, the camera’s picture quality in low light settings is the best it’s ever been, and the battery life is outstanding. Yes, this wasn’t a dramatic visual overhaul of the iPhone, but Apple made significant improvements to the internal components and I am an extremely satisfied customer.",5,2019-09-27 19:31:00
"44","Best yet!","The best iPhone yet! Has an awesome screen with the super retina XDR OLED display. It makes pictures and videos look amazing. The back glass is beautiful, it has the frosted glass look to it. Cameras are amazing and take the best pictures on any smartphone. Love the ultra wide camera. Very fast when performing tasks. With iOS you get updates very quickly and security is the best out there. Face ID is awesome and even faster now. This phone is amazing.",5,2019-10-29 13:06:00
"45","GREAT iPhone","Glad I waited to get this model 11 Pro Max 256 GB so well worth the wait.. LOVING the 3 cameras!!! Love  the photos it takes plus it's a GREAT phone ... Plenty of storage space with the 256 GB easy to use and at last Apple improved battery life thank you Apple. Can go several days without a charge. Newest version of software works great NO issues. Had a iPhone 7 Plus LOVED that iPhone too.... it's for sale on eBay by the way.",5,2019-11-01 15:44:00
"46","Unsurpassed elegance & superb performance","It is like holding a small high powered computer in the palm of your hand. Everything about the iPhone 11 Pro Max is perfect, except the price! The best feature I loved is the new 12MP triple camera system that allows you to take high quality ultra wide photos with ease. Bought this phone for my wife as a replacement for iPhone 8 Plus, and even though the 8 plus is slightly bigger than iPhone 11 Pro Max, the screen is about an inch larger in iPhone 11 Pro than 8 Plus. My wife absolutely loves it.",5,2019-10-04 18:41:00
"47","iPhone lover.","I upgraded from the XS Max. It was well worth the upgrade for the amazing camera and battery life!  The camera is fantastic. It makes it so quick and easy to adjust for close up and wide angle pictures. The clarity is something else. I can go 2 days with one battery charge and I’ve never been able to do that in the past with a iPhone. Don’t hesitate to upgrade!",5,2019-11-09 01:07:00
"48","Upgraded from a iPhone X","I tried the Note 10+ and I REALLY wanted to like that phone but ultimately I ended up returning it and waiting for the iPhone 11 Pro Max.  I just wanted a bigger phone and the iPhone just ticked all the boxes.  I'm not as invested in the Apple infrastructure as I once was but I still chose the iPhone over the Note for fit and finish, reliability and because I don't expect you to put bloatware from Game of Thrones or AT&T for a phone that I paid full price for.",5,2019-09-30 11:48:00
"49","Amazing phone","I had originally purchased one of these for my mother, but liked it so much that I ended up getting it for both of my parents. It is very compatible with all of my other apple products and makes work that much easier. I definitely recommend it!",5,2019-12-22 10:09:00
"50","Boom!","Yes this is a PHONE! Thank you to Best Buy for transfer service and assistance with seamless installation making new phone better version of everything in old one.",5,2020-01-25 11:38:00
"51","Excellent battery life","I'm happy to have upgraded to this phone mostly because of the speed and battery life.  On a typical day, I still have over 75% battery at the end of the day.  On a day where I am constantly using text, browsers, phone calls, etc., it lasted the entire day without needing to be charged until I was ready to go to bed.  I'm still learning all the features of the phone, but I'm very happy with my purchase thus far.",5,2019-10-12 15:14:00
"52","great phone, but not much change","i upgraded from the iPhone 10 so there really isn't too much of a change for me. the camera is a better quality than previous models as one would expect and the battery seems to last longer. If you have the 10 you may as well not upgrade and wait it out for next years iPhone release as it should have bigger changes/upgrades unless you're just looking to have the newest and latest as i did.",5,2019-10-17 17:58:00
"53","AMAZING PHONE","Have to say,  I was hesitant going from my XS max to pro max thinking it would be about the same phone...

it is, however, the camera and software has been fixed from all my gripes and issues with my xs max 

Its making every photo app so much fun , the quality it produces is simply unreal

everything else from design to new screen/battery life improved also.",5,2019-10-24 23:12:00
"54","iPhone 1 Prop MaxGreat item to keep up to date","Very good service, however it is difficult to learn it on your own,  Need some hands on education for such a complicated instrument.  A good video of the various things you need to know would be very helpful.",5,2019-12-27 19:31:00
"55","Love this phone!","I keep my phones for a long time.  So when my iPhone 6 died I looked forward to getting the new iPhone 11 Pro Max.  It’s night and day faster.  The last 2 days.  I charge it every other day.  Camera is great!",5,2019-10-26 14:10:00
"56","Huge upgrade!","I went from a 6s to the best phone Apple has made to date. Obviously the camera quality is amazing. The night pics come out beautifully. But what gets me is the battery life. Don’t have to charge for a few days sometimes! All in all it’s a great phone. Feel like I can hang on to this phone for a long time.",5,2019-11-09 09:21:00
"57","Love it","Only one thing I found to be a bother when your on speaker there’s feedback in to the other persons phone now the only thing I can think of it’s caused by the new battery using or the speaker wires are to close to it but hey Apple fix it please",5,2019-12-06 16:15:00
"58","Another great apple product","This is my wife's phone. She loves it. The battery life has been great! On days during the work week, I honestly belive she could charge it every other day. Cameras, they are as good as everyone says. Pics are crisp and bright. All in all, this is the most I have concidered leaving my beloved pixel line. Good job Apple.",5,2019-11-02 10:22:00
"59","I haven’t had an iPhone within 5 years.","Switched to iPhone because I like what they are doing with the software and a major plus for me is the battery life. Just from normal use, one charge will last me up to 48 hrs. That’s almost unheard of for a phone. As for the camera, it’s like having a DLSR camera in your pocket, almost that is. Build of the iPhone is great, rock solid, but it is on the heavy side for a phone, but it doesn’t bother me.",5,2019-09-27 15:29:00
"60","Amazing upgrade on the camera","It takes beautiful pictures. My only complaint is that it is heavier than my previous phone the iPhone XS Max.  Right out of the box the 11 Pro Max is way heavier than the XS Max is in a case, and  once I put the pro max in a case it just felt so much heavier. I just put it in my backpack or hold it, it’s not really comfortable having it in your pocket",5,2019-10-18 15:55:00
"61","Insane battery life and beautiful","The iPhone 11 Pro Max has the longest battery life I’ve ever experienced in a mobile device. I won give a breakdown as lifestyle and type of usage matters but I will have close  to 70% percent left after the full day. I have zero dead pixels and the HDR OLED screen is just gorgeous. No complaints so far except for AT&T and their backend issues connecting my iWatch to the phone but that’s another story",5,2019-09-27 15:21:00
"62","Good but nothing too exciting","I recently upgraded from the iPhone 7 Plus but I don't find the new iPhone THAT exciting. I do like the facial recognition but I hate that I have to pick up my phone and face it directly at my face for it to work. And the camera are cool but nothing I couldn't do by zooming on my old phone...except the wide angle. I do like that. But this phone feels so much bigger in my hand so I am actually exchanging it for the 11 Pro instead of the 11 Pro Max.",4,2019-10-17 17:01:00
"63","Love It!","Traded in my fairly new iPhone X 258 for this iPhone 11 Max Pro 512. It has the bigger screen like the 8+. The battery lasts abut 4 hours longer for me than my X, and the fast charger goes to 80% in about 330 minutes. Awesome. I haven’t used the cameras much, except for the wide-angle for landscapes and a few group selfies. 

I love this new phone. I didn’t need it, but what the heck. LOL",5,2019-09-27 15:20:00
"64","Love my new iPhone 11 Pro Max","This a wonderful update from my iPhone 6. I was happy with the large screen and it worked great until fell into my pool a week before the new version was to be released. So what the heck, why not go for biggest and best. The camera is fantastic! And it is water resistant! But I have no plans on testing that. I like the new OS which is now also on my iPad. Couldn’t live without either.",5,2019-09-28 11:18:00
"65","In love with new I phone pro max","Love love love the new I phone 11 pro max
The ease of operation coming from an I phone e7 max is amazing",5,2020-02-02 15:52:00
"66","Switched from Android (Samsung) to Apple","Wife wanted to make the move to Apple and so far loves the new phone.  Obviously had to adjust to some of the new things relating to Apple but have enjoyed the phone and no regrets yet.  I still have my Samsung and not sure if I will convert so will someday need to make that choice when I get a new phone.",5,2019-11-01 15:32:00
"67","Great overall phone, camera is excellent","If upgrading from an iPhone 8 or earlier, the performance and enhanced camera and other capabilities are worth the price. From a later phone, your mileage may vary. The camera would be the main difference there. Phone feels good in the hand and seems like it is not a slippery. Slightly thicker but seems solid, Picture is very clear and phone speakers pack more volume. No complaints.",5,2019-09-27 16:32:00
"68","Nice, but beware of learning curve","The display is a lot better than my old 6S Plus. However I cannot find a case I like in the color I like unless I bought the 11.  It is pretty much the same size and feel as the 6S Plus, so no changes in fitting my inside coat pocket. The only big problem I had was that the tech at my local Best Buy inserted my old sim card instead of the new one. This led to a few hours on the phone with AT&T to figure out why I had no service the next day.",4,2019-12-13 22:01:00
"69","Great upgrade over my old phone","Functionality is pretty much the same as my old iPhone but pictures and security are a nice upgrade",5,2020-01-31 16:17:00
"70","Best smart phone ever!!","The iPhone 11 pro max is a great smart phone. It’s a little thicker than the last phone but I prefer it better and that means a bigger battery and longer battery life which is absolutely amazing. Everything works so seamlessly smooth and fast that includes Face ID swiping and app response time.  You will not be disappointed and I upgraded from the iPhone XS Max",5,2019-10-03 19:28:00
"71","The iPhone 11 Pro Max is worth the upgrade!","You’ve read about the phone, the screen, the processor and the camera... It’s all true... the iPhone 11 is well worth the upgrade!  In addition, the battery has an unbelievable life!!  Still playing with the camera and it’s ability to switch between wide, normal and telephoto lenses.  The only downer, the phone is expensive...",5,2019-10-18 16:33:00

I love my new phone though .. I also bought a watch to match; whoop",5,2019-12-06 10:17:00
"74","A fantastic piece of technology","A definite step forward in the evolution of the iPhone that checks all the right boxes, from build quality to battery capacity and management to camera refinement and image quality. In conclusion, even if high in price, it is the best iteration of the current iPhone design.",5,2019-11-08 18:13:00
"75","This is better than the  iphone 10 x","If you liked the  iphone 6 plus this is the same size as this WITH no loss of screen with borders and a button like back then  great looking phone !!",5,2020-01-07 17:42:00
"76","10/10 apple does it again","Wonderful upgrade from my previous 8 plus. I am a photographer so I wanted to see exactly how the cameras functioned compared to my DSLRs. Not too shabby! I actually just went on a weekend vacation with just my phone and I was pleased with the quality. The battery life is fantastic and I honestly can’t say anything bad about it!",5,2019-10-11 15:18:00
"77","Huge Upgrade from 8 Plus","I stretched out the life of my iPhone 8 Plus for as much as I could. While this phone doesn't seem to be as big a of leap from the iPhone X, it's a huge difference from the 8 Plus. The three cameras aren't as cumbersome as I thought they would be, and actually serve a great purpose. The phone itself feels great in the hand and looks clean as well.",5,2019-10-01 12:50:00
"78","Best Iphone Yet","The resolution and pictures from this new iphone are state of the art. It is snappier than the previous generation. If you are on the fence about the bigger size, go for it. I have big fingers and this size really has improved my typing experience.",5,2019-11-18 08:54:00
"79","Super fast","Great new phone with lightening speed, great clarity, easy to use, fantastic battery life, sharp pictures, large screen, , and video replay like no other phone sold in the past.

"84","Stove top...nah!","The super wide camera lense is amazing I’ve been able to take great images using it!! I really like the added battery life.

I’m super happy with this purchase.",5,2019-10-04 17:08:00

"86","Best I phone I’ve had","So I’m loyal nonetheless to say too Apple but I must say The 11 has the best speaker system it’s ever had, Siri understanding a lot smother. The response time is better across the board. And finally the battery life has lasted me a day and half on a full charge.... YEA I SAID IT",5,2019-10-25 16:22:00
"87","Excellent Love the screen","I watch a lot of video on my phone, always learning new things.

From YouTube to Plex or really any app benefits from this device greatly compared to other models",5,2019-10-28 11:40:00
"88","Best in a while","Really the best iPhone in years. The camera(s) especially. The first time In years that a photo opportunity didn’t make me wish I had my DSLR instead. I was honestly a little disappointed with the iphoneX and wasn’t very interested with the follow up XR and XS, which in retrospect makes me very happy I waited. Good job",5,2019-10-04 10:21:00
"89","Great phone","Upgraded from the Iphone 7plus. Love the Face ID to  unlock the phone. The fingerprint reader was never reliable for me on the 7plus, because my hands are so dry I suppose.

"95","Camera is Amazing","Before this phone I had the 8s plus and didn’t plan to upgrade until I saw this bad boy and I am so glad I did. This phone is amazing.

"96","Awesome Phone - Coming from iPhone X","Battery Life is probably the best part of this phone. Coming from the iPhone X, my battery would be close to dead by 6-7pm. This phone is probably around 60% by then and includes the fast charger. Camera is amazing, and the speed of the phone is great.

Totally worth the upgrade from the X, if you can.",5,2019-10-08 13:43:00
"97","Loving the new phone","This is an upgrade from the iPhone 8 Plus. I love the difference from the 8th. I’m still trying to get my way around it with the new update and technique.

"158","I miss the bigger memory","I was convinced by the salesman to go lower in memory because it won’t matter. I had the 128 7plus (I know, it was time to upgrade) and never had memory issues. iPhone decided not to do that model no more and I don’t really need the 256, so I listened to the salesman and went down in memory space.

"161","I have some issues, but I’m happy I upgraded","Previously, I had a iPhone 7 Plus and wanted to upgrade, but did not need to. It is a good phone, but it freezes on me multiple times of the day. It also does not like doing multiple things at once. Take for instance when I have my phone connect to Apple car play and using WAYS I can only have 25 - 30 minute phone calls. A lot of the time it refuses to maintain a connection after that and I have to call them back after it hangs up. If it stays on for longer then WAYS stops working and turns itself off. This sucks for me because I’m always on the road. It also likes to disconnect from Bluetooth while I’m in the car (While not plugged into anything) during a call and I have to either try to connect it back to my car or restart my phone. Really that’s all I’ve really had to deal with since I purchased the phone. When it works properly it’s a great phone, but that is rare.",3,2019-12-03 11:56:00

It did not turn on???? I brought it home and found the left side of phone was open I new it would be very hard to explain so I didn’t don’t like to blame someone for something I can’t prove!

"718","Very similar to iPhone XS Max","I would not upgrade from the XS Max. This phone is such an incremental upgrade and all their efforts were put on the iOS 13 . Which is amazing.  But the camera upgrade; no human can even tell",3,2019-10-18 15:50:00

"723","Not missing much from previous models","Unless you really focus on the camera, you are not really missing much on this yearly upgrade, this iteration does not envy that much from the previous XS model!  unless you are upgrading from an iphone 7 or less you are good!!",2,2020-01-10 15:48:00
"724","Better camera","Camera is nice but the phone is not shatter resistant, mine broke the next day. So if you’re planning on buying this phone make sure you get a good phone case.",3,2019-10-04 16:48:00

"728","I really like this iphone 11 Pro Max","I hold on to my phones for as long as I can.  I detest the cost that Apple prices their products at and I would have kept using my iphone 6s if it didn't start to slow down, have issues with latest updates and just plain cranky.  Shame because it was a great little smart phone.  I like that I could buy the iphone outright at Best Buy and I was up and running within minutes.  Lots of new whistles and bells and I adore the camera and what it offers but especially the long batter life.  I can shoot/save video and hundreds of images at an event and still have nearly 80% battery life at the end of of the day.",5,2019-11-16 14:32:00
"729","Cool","It's good and the service is great. I would use att for all my service",5,2019-09-20 13:35:00
"730","Great upgrade","Upgraded from iPhone X and so happy with this purchase. Best Buy made this an easy transition through my At&T service and had the phone in stock as compared to waiting 3 weeks via At&t. 
The biggest difference I've noticed is the battery life which is pretty amazing and I feel is nearly double from the iPhone X. Lastly the camera takes amazing pics and I've just scratched the surface with using the pic modes.",5,2019-12-05 07:29:00
"731","Bad headache.","Since the pro models have OLED screens, they have a phenomenon called PWM. You can research it. There is a population of users that suffer from nasty headaches after using these even after a short duration. No only iPhones though. 

Exchanged it for an iPhine 11 and never looked back.",1,2019-11-30 23:46:00
"732","Great smartphone","This is an excellent upgrade from iPhone 6 s plus. Front and rear Camera takes perfect pictures, battery lasts a day easily, speakers are very good. Screen resolution and size is perfect. Finish of the phone is better than other smartphones.  
I hope Apple also releases a stylus in upcoming models at the same price or less, otherwise I feel it’s expensive phone by couple hundred dollars.",5,2019-11-29 10:02:00
"733","Apple get it Together!","Before upgrading to this phone, my phone worked perfectly fine. Great reception! Fast loading of websites! 
Then I got this expensive phone... dropped calls left and right! We page doesn’t load, hotspot can’t connect!! I don’t know but maybe wait till they fix all the bugs...",1,2019-11-15 16:43:00

"751","New iphone","I love my iPhone 11 Pro Max!  I had my iPhone 6 Plus for 5 years and the phone had to be plugged in all the time because even after adding two batteries, phone would not hold a charge!  I did not need all the bells and whistles on this camera since I just take pics of my dogs, but the battery life in this phone is great and processor is very fast!  The screen quality is great too! This iPhone 11 is the same size phone as my 6 plus, but with bigger screen since there is no home button, just face recognition!  It is heavier than the 6 plus, but I am getting g used to it!  I hated to give up my iPhone 6 Plus, but I also wanted a 256 GB and my old phone was only 128!",5,2020-01-15 20:34:00

"755","Phone","Great camera for pictures. Iphones are always user friendly.",5,2019-11-21 13:58:00
"756","Works great","This is my wife’s phone, and it offers significant advantages over our old 6s’s. First, facial recognition has been flawless not only for the phone, but for apps that accept it. It also is much easier to unlock and use (just look at the face of the phone) than finger print recognition. We also like the fact that we can get a charging pad for it, rather than having to plug and unplug a charging wire. The Apple wires are too short, and the longer 3rd-party ones do not hold up with constant use. The gold color also is quite striking.",5,2019-12-31 13:21:00
"757","Love the ease of use and the camera","This phone has a longer battery life, camera is amazing, and the phone is sleek and attractive",4,2020-01-04 07:47:00
"758","I Love This Phone!","This phone has a large screen with face recognition and is equipped with 256G of storage. That is plenty enough to store lots of apps and photos. The camera is amazing and the photos even look good in low light. The wide angle lens is an added bonus that comes in handy more than I expected. The reverse camera saves at a high resolution to take quality photos. I bought this phone mainly for the camera and I have not been disappointed.",5,2020-01-11 11:38:00
"759","Best iPhone Ever","I upgraded from an Apple 6S Plus, and while I thought my old phone was good, this one is amazing.  The battery life is outstanding.  I can go 2 days without a charge, and I use my phone constantly.  The camera is amazing as well.  I highly recommend this phone. It's expensive, but worth it!",5,2020-01-10 18:34:00
"760","Love my new phone.","Since updating my iPhone X to the 11 Pro Max I am extremely satisfied.  Of course the phone feel and is much larger but not too large.  As a senior with poor eyesight it’s nice to have a larger screen and bigger font sizes.

The best thing is the camera upgrade.  I’m still learning how to use all the camera features but am impressed with the photos I’ve taken so far!",5,2019-12-14 00:40:00
"761","Best so far!","This year I wasn’t planning to purchase this phone but after watching all the reviews on Youtube I don’t regret my decision.  Same notch and looks since the 10 came out but the performance, battery life and picture quality won me over.  And tbh unless someone is that distracted or is that bothered, 99% of the time the notch doesn’t phase me",5,2019-12-17 14:16:00
"762","Apple iPhone Pro Max 11","I recently purchased a replacement iPhone. I chose the Apple iPhone promax 11. I believe the biggest improvement for this iPhone is the camera. Especially in low lighting, my sister who also owns an iPhone could not take as good of pictures and little lighting as I could. We experimented. Of course the iPhone is the Cadillac of phones and the rest of the features are intuitive and useful. By the way it makes a pretty good phone toI",5,2019-11-15 16:17:00
"763","Great phone love it","I just upgraded to the iPhone 11 Pro Max today at my local Best Buy store I needed a new phone because I had the iPhone X this first one that came out.

"764","It is better than expected even","Extremely fast and the screen is stunning.  I knew it would take good pictures but just WOW.  The picture quality is unbelievable.  I have tried to take some photos in the dark that I expected to be too dark to use but look amazing.  Glad I made this purchase.",5,2019-12-29 07:48:00
"765","Great Job, Apple!","This newest generation is beyond my expectations!  I decided it was time to upgrade my five year old 6+ and I decided on this model. The facial recognition alone is pretty amazing plus the camera takes such nice pictures. I haven’t had time to go through all of the tips and tricks. Austin at the Edwardsville IL was outstanding and made everything so easy!",5,2019-11-22 18:21:00
"766","Great camera!","So far I’ve got the phone for about a week and love it! The camera is awesome with all 3 lenses to give you different depths while taking photos. Not having a home button is new to me so it’s an adjustment. So far I love it!",5,2020-01-10 16:25:00
"767","Love the screen!","Either your an apple person or your not. If you are this phone is great. I upgraded from a 7+ and there are enough features with this model to feel like its worth it, bigger better screen, the 3 cameras, facial recognition, no home button. I thought removing the home button was going to be hard to get used to, but only took about a day, and I don't miss it.",5,2019-11-15 18:22:00
"768","Best iPhone yet","This iPhone I can’t tell you enough good things. I haven’t had an iPhone is 6 years I went Samsung. I decided to switch back and got this iPhone and I don’t think I’ll ever go back to Samsung. The biggest amazement I have had is the battery life. I have never gone below 40% battery and I use my phone ALOT. The phone is fast and extremely easy to use",5,2019-11-15 16:04:00
"769","Excellent quality photos","The studio lighting feature on this camera ia amazing, really studio quality photos.  The Max is a little bigger that the iPhone X.  Overall not much difference noticed beside the better camera.  A good buy.",5,2020-01-04 11:14:00
"770","Excellent!","Absolutely love it!!  Love the gold color and the camera is fantastic. So glad I purchased the larger model as I watch a lot of videos on my phone and it looks great on the larger screen.",5,2020-01-10 15:41:00
"771","Great phone but similar to iPhone XS Max.","I got this phone thinking it was going to have more new features than the iPhone XS Max and well it really doesn’t. I don’t see a huge difference from the pictures with the two either. I did come from using an iPhone 7+ so don’t get my wrong it takes amazing pictures. On some of the apps on the top of the screen where the speaker is it does cut off onto some apps other than that the phone does work nicely.",5,2019-10-04 23:26:00
"772","Excellent design and amazing camera","I have upgraded from an iphone 6 plus and the difference in performance is night and day!
