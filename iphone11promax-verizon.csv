"1","Great at everything!","Recently tried my hand with the galaxy S10+, it was a really good phone but I was missing my iPhone.  So I ordered the Pro Max after reading the improvements.  While it looks extremely similar to the last gen iPhone it’s so much more.  The cameras are phenomenal, better than my galaxy by far in pictures and video.  The speed and smoothness of IOS is unrivaled by any operating system I have tried.  Oh and the battery... I can’t believe this is an iPhone, I’m a very heavy user and can make it all day easily without having to worry about having a charger near by.  I was highly impressed with the S10+ battery, the iPhone exceeds what it could do.  I’m not thrilled about the price, but if you’re here you already the iPhone is very expensive.  If you’re on the fence and have the money available just go ahead and do yourself a favor and upgrade.",5,2019-11-01 21:31:00
"2","UNREAL!!!!","The camera upgrade on the iPhone 11 alone should be enough for anyone to WANT the new iPhone, but there is so much more!!

Faster, more powerful, easier access AND noticeable better battery levels!!!!

But the camera must be used to be fully appreciated!!",5,2019-10-04 17:04:00
"3","The best feeling iphone I have ever owned!","I upgraded from a I phone x to the iPhone 11 pro max. I wasn’t expecting much of a difference besides the camera, but it turns out that it is a huge difference. I’m a web developer and I do a lot of work on my phone, and the iPhone X would sometimes get sluggish. The iPhone 11 pro max really handles well under pressure, and the quality is overall excellent.",5,2019-09-21 20:37:00
"4","Wow Factor","The camera is superb my dslr has very little if anything on this camera and the usability is amazing",5,2019-09-27 15:26:00
"5","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Exceeded all my expectations. Faster, more elegant the silver is beautiful and the green – my choice-  beautiful. The camera is indescribably so much better. Well worth the upgrade or the general expense to change over. Apple outdid it self.",5,2019-10-26 21:01:00

"8","This is just the best","I really love this phone the best purchase I’ve made so far as far as a purchase of a new phone",5,2019-09-30 00:01:00
"9","Definitely the best iPhone to date...that camera","I was unable to find the iPhone 11 Pro Max anywhere. They were out of stock everywhere ya looked. I was able to locate a few gray ones in 64 GB at the Best Buy in Chapel Hill.

Dylan Seibel was a great help if I may add. He knew all the ins and outs and details to get me the best deal on a trade in / port to Verizon.

Got $450 for my iPhone 8 Plus. Got a $200 MasterCard gift card, and free Unlimited Apple Music for the term of my contract.

Do auto-pay and get another $10 off. Veteran? Get another $15 off monthly.

Can’t beat it.

Oh. And that camera on this model is: Wow. I posted some sample pics I took. Battery: Another wow. Love the OLED super bright screen, too. If you’re on the fence, jump over it. You won’t regret buying the IPhone 11 Pro Max.

Thanks, BestBuy / Verizon / Dylan Seibel.",5,2019-10-04 16:38:00
"10","Yes","It’s a very awesome phone the best one I ever had so far",5,2019-10-25 21:38:00
"11","A lot of the same with some goodies mixed in","The phone is very familiar if you are A long time iPhone user, the camera is very very good especially video recording in 4K and stabilization, the speakers are top-notch. The battery lasts all day no need to charge which is great. My only gripe with the phone is the weight increase is noticeable and sometimes uncomfortable But I do recommend it",5,2019-10-05 14:25:00
"12","Best iPhone I’ve own","Cameras are amazing for a cellphone battery life is all day and then some screen is bright and crisp well worth the upgrade",5,2020-01-04 00:12:00
"13","Love the camera lenses!","Took this phone as well as my Nikon camera on vacation to Arizona and Nevada. The pictures on the phone were of such great quality that I put away my Nikon and only used the camera on the phone.",5,2019-10-18 16:40:00
"14","LOVE IT!!!","I typically don't upgrade in a year, but I wanted to upgrade to the phone from my XS Max Plus due to the added camera features before my trip to Iceland.  I'm so glad that I did.  The picture quality is amazing!!!!  Love that the 10 second low light exposure feature allowed me to get decent shots of the Northern lights.  I cannot get over the quality of photos this phone has!  No regrets!",5,2019-11-12 11:08:00
"15","Fantastic upgrade that is surprisingly worth it","Coming from an iPhone XS Max, I didn’t to be wowed by the iPhone 11 Pro Max. But after using it for a couple of weeks, I have really appreciated the improvements that have been made. The battery life is the best I’ve seen in an iPhone. I’m getting whole day battery life with the screen brightness at 1/5 the bar, a big improvement to the XS Max which I kept the brightness lower. The cameras are also greatly improved, which the ultra wide lense and Night Mode have made taking pictures more fun and satisfying. The front camera finally brings a wider camera making group pictures much easier to frame. The loss of 3D Touch is unfortunate as I really enjoyed using it in different ways, but I would rather sacrifice it if it means we continue to have much larger batteries going forward. The other differences such as the newer processor aren’t really noticeable but are likely important for more strenuous tasks and device longevity. Finally, the midnight green color is great.

Honestly I don’t think everyone should upgrade to this iPhone if their current iPhone is working fine. I upgraded because I lack self control and like having the latest, greatest iPhone. But if you are moving from a 8 or older, you’re in for a treat.",5,2019-09-29 22:50:00
"16","Battery Life and Camera’s are top notch!","I jump back from Android and iPhone fairly often. I feel confident that iPhone 11 Pro Max is sticking around for a while. The battery life is amazing! It’s one thing to hear about it, but another to see it in action! The battery lasts all day and that’s with me checking Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter pretty often along with using FaceTime and YouTube. I only need to charge when going to bed, but if I needed to charge because I’m heading somewhere the fast charging is super fast. Coming from a Pixel 3XL I’m no stranger to fast charge, but this seems much faster. 
Oh and the Camera’s. They are so great! I was apprehensive about leaving my Pixel’s camera behind especially with family moments and young kids, but the iPhone camera is really amazing. And the night shot feature is really good as well! 
The phone itself is iPhone. iOS, icons, notch, etc. none of those things are negatives for me, but consider that too when choosing between camps. 
Oh 1 more thing... the sound!! So loud and very good with the 3D feeling of the sound. It’s all software I’m assuming, but those speakers had me turning left and right even when watching a YouTube video! Great speakers! I thought I would miss forward facing speakers on my Pixel, but these are so good and loud!",5,2019-09-27 16:02:00
"17","Very happy with this phone.","I upgraded from an XR and can say this phone was a nice upgrade over that model and really enjoy using this phone.

The screen looks nice and pictures are awesome, but the real story here is the battery life. While the XR had great battery life the 11 Pro Max has phenomenal battery life. Apple has always done a great job  with standby battery usage, but the battery would drop quickly with heavier usage. The XR was better, but this Pro Max does not have that issue at all. I believe it is a combination of the larger battery and A13 chip efficiency. Consumer reports is reporting 40 hours of simulated user usage with the Pro Max versus 29 hours with the XS Max. 

This was an upgrade I was on the fence about, and honestly did it so I could pass the XR to my son. I had planned to wait until next year. 5G is not a big deal for me and my son needs a phone now. I also needed the 2x zoom on the camera. I like the 11 Pro Max has the lightning connector also since I have other devices that have the same connection. I can say the battery life and camera made the upgrade worth it. I am also glad I sprung for the 512 GB version because I am going to keep this phone for a while.",5,2019-10-05 03:18:00
"18","Another Great Release","I’ll admit that I remain an Apple fan due to everything working well together and for it just fits my needs. This new one is definitely faster and new iOS makes it more intuitive. Camera is definitely better than the already good on in the XS Max and battery life is definitely better. Holds up after heavy use all day so far. If you want better battery life and camera upgrades this is headed in the right direction. iPhone XSMax pictures are amazing and who wouldn’t want longer battery without having to use battery packs.",5,2019-09-23 00:33:00
"19","Its All About Preference","I used to work in the mobile section at best buy (between 2015 and 2018) and the iphone honestly hasnt evolved too much since around the iphone 6s. This isnt a bad thing honestly. Instead of striving for innovation they strive for perfection. The iphone is sleek, clean, and easy to use where as android is complex and customizable. When looking to purchase this phone I would base off what you currently have and what youre looking for. Iphone is very surface level and android lets you dive deep. At this point in the phone game it falls to preference. Both are great but I prefer iPhone and the apple ecosystem.",5,2019-12-26 16:03:00
"20","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I originally wanted the Midnight Green but they sold out, so settled for the Space Gray, and I love it, my iPhone 10 Max was Space Gray as well. The battery life on this is the truth, I can literally get a entire day out it, and that’s including watching videos, playing games, and Surfing the web and social media, and Apple including the 18watt battery charger which is THE TRUTH meaning it WORKS I was like 13% late one night I plugged in the 18 watt charger And went from 13% to like 35% in like 15 minutes , IOS 13.1",5,2019-09-27 16:48:00
"21","Superior Customer Service","The phone is amazing, as normal with Apple, but this post is more about my experience than the product. Best Buy sent me a great offer to trade in my iPhone X to get direct credit towards the purchase of an 11 Pro if I preordered. They gave me a great offer for my trade in, so I went ahead and accepted the offer. When I went to pick up my new phone, it refused to activate, and ended up being a system issue on. Verizon’s side. To make a long story short, I was in the store for about 5 hours while the mobile team did everything in their power to try and resolve the issue, but they were unable to. We ended up having to cancel the order and reorder a different phone. The perseverance and customer service that everyone from the mobile team showed me was AMAZING, and despite the frustration with the activation issue, I am even more loyal to Best Buy because of their hard work and great attitudes. Thank you to Lauren, Mikeah (spelling?), and Store Manager Tim.",5,2019-10-13 16:43:00
"22","All around GREAT iPhone! Worth the upgrade.","Coming from the iPhone XS Max makes this upgrade not as big as coming from an older model such as the 6S or 7,8 Plus however I’m still glad I upgraded. 
You can see the deeper contrast in the screen compared to the X, and XS. The cameras are amazing and the battery life is GREAT! depending on your use, I’ve been able to go two days without charging. The speed and smooth operation of the phone is what can be expected with a new iPhone and A13 chip. If you have an older plus model or even the X or XS I would definitely upgrade if you can afford it. Reception is also better than the XS Max.",5,2019-10-05 23:08:00
"23","Great camera","easy to Use
Good camera
Nice sounds
But heavy..
Thats the only thing i dont like with this..
But all in all is good",4,2019-12-13 17:34:00
"24","The iPhone 11 Pro Max is great.","Short and sweet the phone is great.  I was impressed to see how fast and easy it was to set up.  That is once I got past an issue.  The phone I wanted, in Space Gray, was not in stock at the Best Buy store and had to be mailed to me.  It turned out the the Verizon SIM card that was included could not be recognized.  A Best Buy Support rep tried to help me and was unsuccessful.  I have to go to my local Verizon store to get help with the problem.  Turns out they only had to swap the SIM from my current phone to the new iPhone and subsequently everything went well with the setup.  Then came the next issue when I found that I couldn't make calls and would get a Verizon error message that the account was not active.  Fortunately a quick call to Verizon had this problem resolved.  I don't know why the Verizon support rep didn't think to check on that.",5,2019-10-05 13:13:00
"25","From android to iphone","My family have converted me to a IPhone user. I have been team android for many years. It was time for an upgrade so I finally convert to Apple. I am very please so far it has only been a week using my iPhone 11 pro max. I am still trying to navigate using this iPhone. It takes some getting use too not having an actual back button and the actual vibrate option. That is the reason for my rating of average on the ease of use.
Overall, once I become comfortable with using the iPhone I sure I will be please and never go back to an android phone.",5,2019-12-06 15:44:00
"26","Loveeeee","I’ll be honest when this phone first came out I hated it & thought the 3 cameras were ugly but then I warned up to it and it’s perfect
Not too sure on all the camera features but it dies take amazing pictures especially at night time.. we the flash it doesn’t even look like it was completely dark",5,2020-02-01 10:29:00
"27","Nice upgrade for 8+ and x users","I have an XR on my business phone and would say that this is a small upgrade from last years phones unless you are a camera person. So upgrading from a XS,XSM, or XR is less likely that you will see huge improvement or need to upgrade. The one big difference I saw from my iPhone X is the battery life on the pro max is fantastic. I pull my phone off the charger before going to bed and I can still get through a whole day work day and not needing a charge until around 9-10pm. I would consider myself a power user as throughout the day I have emails, spreadsheets, and YouTube streaming in the background for 4-5 hours amongst other items. The cameras are a big improvement and really close the short fall they had in low light photography. The iPhone went from not competing in low light to trading blows with what is considered the best camera on a smartphone the google pixel. I can honestly say I’m not regretting my purchase and if you have a iPhone X or later the small improvements will make you happy with your purchase.",4,2019-10-04 22:23:00
"28","Fantastic Product!","This is a premier product. The wide angle lens is one of the original wide angle lenses and really adds the ability to get The Big picture. I've been wanting that feature for a while and comes in handy when you just can't backup any further due to obstructions. As for the other two lenses and the overall camera quality, it's fantastic.

I own other phones as well. Android is great, but if stability in updates is what you want, and you want the updates to keep coming - you can't beat Apple.

Remember this - Apple produces the OS and the iPhone. The two are mated together and maintained to high standards.",5,2019-11-15 17:13:00
"29","best Iphone yet","I have been using an iPhone 8plus and was very happy with everything , once this product was launched I just wanted to see one and experience the screen and camera. Let me say that if you do not have an iPhone X or above then you are missing out 
the screen is amazing and the new bionic chip makes using the phone and apps feel like the first time I used an iPhone, it is that much better. Last if you are not using best buy for all you electronic needs you need to switch and really look into what they do and how good their customer service is.  Apple has out done themselves!",5,2019-11-22 16:21:00
"30","Upgraded from iPhone 8 Plus","I have had this phone for about two weeks now and so far it’s been great.  I upgraded from an iPhone 8 Plus.  The screen has better resolution, the camera is great (for a phone).  One of the main things I like about the new phone is that it’s the size of my old iPhone 8 Plus but with a larger screen that’s sharper.  I have also noticed this phone is a tad quicker to load apps with the new processor.

One thing that I thought was going to be a problem for me is the lack of the home button on my other iPhones, but I was able to adjust after a day of using the phone.  Also the Face ID feature is a cool update and I have adjusted to this.

I would recommend this phone, just wish apple would calm down with the prices!",5,2019-10-20 19:34:00
"31","Worth the Upgrade","First off S/O to Best Buy for not only having the phone in stock but having in my case Verizon experts in store. I’d like to start off by saying that the phone exceeded my expectations. As we all know phones nowadays are pretty much the same each year with minor updates (Android or Apple).As this may be true for this year’s model it still surpasses all previous generations. From the OS to the fast charge and yes even the obvious. The three cameras on the back which for me (a loyal phone photographer) is my favorite feature and update. The camera quality is beyond amazing. Anyway before I keep going on about how great this phone is go on in and buy one for yourself you wont regret it!",5,2019-10-26 05:36:00
"32","New to Apple","I’ve been an Android user and this is my first Apple product. The switch is very easy, I find most everything to be very intuitive and user friendly. I can’t wait to dive into the triple cameras and see what I can create. The phone is very stout and feels expensive... and it is.",5,2020-01-31 15:49:00
"33","The cameras make it unbelievable","I purchase a new iPhone every year and every year I am amazed at what Apple does with every new upgrade. Granted, some people say that some upgrades have been ho hum but this year Apple has come across with some game changers. The first big change is the cameras, they have to be experienced to be believed. The battery life is over the top improved. For most of my previous iPhones I purchased a battery case because they didn’t quite make it through the day but that won’t be necessary with this one. This phone has at least 30% battery at the end of a very heavy day of use. If you are an iPhone person, you have to seriously consider this one, it’s a true joy to behold.",5,2019-10-04 18:59:00
"34","Love the iPhone 11 Pro Max","I upgraded so that my husband could have my “old” iPhone X. The biggest change in this new phone was the three cameras, but I haven’t used the special features that much. This one also has the bigger screen, which I love because it’s much easier for me to see and text on. I’m a big fan of Apple products because they all connect to one another and that makes it easier for me to sign into websites and apps across multiple devices. The price is high of course, but I was able to use some of my Best Buy rewards to help with that.",5,2019-10-26 16:34:00
"35","A new adventure from Androis","I've owned a Samsung Galaxy from the first one they made.  I was very disappointed with the 7th generation but lived with it for several years.  I finally moved over to an iPhone and am very pleased with it.  The battery lasts forever!  The FaceTime feature is fun.  The only downside it that I had my Android completely customized with ringers and notifications for specific people in my contacts.  I highly recommend this phone!",5,2019-11-22 18:04:00
"36","Loving It","By far the best iPhone I have had (it should be since it is the newest one) but what really impresses me is the extremely long battery life (I normally drain my battery by the afternoon because I am a heavy user of the phone but this phone lasts two days before I need to charge it) and the low light ability of the camera. I have been using Verizon with this phone and I now have better service with this phone and am getting 165 mbps on 4G LTE in some areas. It really is a great phone and is super fast.",5,2019-10-30 09:19:00
"37","Overall best iPhone ever!!!","I have had both iPhone and android phones and i continue to come back to iPhone. Overall great built. Sturdy in hand and cameras are AMAZING!!! Great pictures no matter the lighting. Priced a bit high but as they say, you have to pay to play.",5,2019-10-11 19:14:00
"38","Awesome Phone","I upgraded from a iPhone 7 plus to a iPhone 11 Pro Max and it is a big difference.  I had an adjustment with the 11 and no home button.  The quality of the camera is phenomenal.  However I did notice the 11 is slightly heavier than my 7 plus, but the size is the same.  I do like the fact that you don't have to press the home button twice to get all the open apps.  On the 11, you just swipe up on your bottom tool bar and all the apps that are open appear.  Overall I am thrilled with the 11.",5,2019-10-26 11:04:00
"39","Unbelievable battery life!!!","Absolutely love this phone!! Camera is mind blowing and best of all, you get all day heavy battery life and that’s #1 to me!",5,2019-09-21 17:02:00
"40","Best I phone yet!","Such an amazing product from Apple. Of you’re on the fence about upgrading take my advice and do it ! The camera, the battery, the specs... all of it is worth the buy.",5,2020-01-31 18:47:00
"41","A nice upgrade!","I upgraded an iPhone 8+ to the iPhone 11 Pro Max and I’m thoroughly enjoying it. The camera quality is excellent, It’s very fast,  and feels very nice in the hand",5,2019-09-20 16:26:00
"42","so far we love it","the camera is why we decided to upgrade and so far we are not disappointed.... i just hope the battery life stays as good as it is now. a few changes make for a little bit of a learning curve and alot of youtube watches to figure out how to do simple things and im not happy it does not come with the headphone/ charge combo jack and that i have to buy it on my own... for 1500 it should be included.... but thats apple for ya...",5,2019-10-25 19:16:00

"44","Upgrade from iPhone XS Max","I had the silver iPhone XS Max and was going to skip this iPhone 11 Pro Max, but the cameras and sound quality is much better. I loved my XS Max, but I love this iPhone even more. For me I want the best quality in cameras, but if that does not matter to you, you may want to wait until next year. However, the battery life on this thing is astounding! A but heavier and thicker than last year, but that's what we wanted to get a bigger battery!",5,2019-10-20 09:07:00
"45","Great Iphone.","Best iphone ever.  Improved face id. Fast processor. Great green Matt finish.  IOS13 is great.  Switch from S10 plus.  Only negative is too heavy which gives limited case. Also slightly wider than S10 plus.",5,2020-01-15 17:20:00
"46","It's good but...","I switch back and forth between iPhones and Galaxy Notes. There are Pros and Cons with both. I LOVE iPhones because they just work! Hardly ever bugs. My work apps run faster and smoother. I just always have 100% confidence in the device. But the Cons from switching from the Note 9, this thing is heavy. It's really heavy compared to the Note 9. And it's also big. I'm a big guy with pretty big hands and I can't comfortably reach all corners with one hand. But this thing works so well that the Pros out weigh those Cons. It's not perfect but I'm happy with it.",4,2019-12-11 19:42:00
"47","Apple has continued!!","I have had Samsung and apple. I know both are constantly competing. For me, iPhones have always been my favorite. This phone is no different. From the facial recognition to the camera to the speed of loading. This phone has been spectacular.",5,2019-12-31 17:15:00
"48","Wow","I am not a ""fanboy"" of either Apple or Samsung, In fact, I own Motorola, OnePlus, and even Essential devices. It was not my intention to purchase this upon my BB visit.

Disappointment with the value=absolutley not.",5,2019-10-26 09:53:00

"50","Excellent phone. Great camera and snappy performan","Upgraded from a 6s, so of course I am impressed. My wife wanted me to update so I could send better photos of our son, and this phone definitely does not disappoint. While the camera appears to be the main marketing point, the phone itself performs great. It takes some getting used to the lack of home button, but the facial recognition seems to take care of any delays for unlocking the phone. Very happy with my upgrade",5,2019-10-18 16:13:00

"52","Best iPhone ever","I love this new iPhone.  I traded in my iPhone 7Plus and it was worth the upgrade. 

The triple lens camera with night mode, 4K video are amazing, and of course the speed is sweet. The updated Face ID has been I joy. You can lie it down and it reads your Face ID smoothly.  The missing items was reverse charging and 5G, but the 5G is still new maybe by 2021 it will be more mainstream.",5,2019-10-26 00:34:00
"53","good but I like my iphone X better","it is a good cell phone but if you need to upgrade from iPhone X ?
I don't know. I still did not find anything really better than iPhone X. I guess it is just the way apple make their business. every year new generation iPhone and people spend money to get the newest one",4,2019-12-20 16:51:00
"54","Great overall phone","I switched from Samsung to Apple.  I loved my Samsung but find the iPhone to be more intuitive.  I haven’t used the camera feature yet but am going to travel soon and am looking forward to using it.",5,2019-12-28 08:16:00

"56","I expected more","iPhones are great, don’t get me wrong. The battery life on this phone is phenomenal and the camera is pretty awesome too, but, it has some downfalls. The day after I purchased the phone my notification sounds were glitchy a few times which was odd to me. I’ve never had that happen before with any other model and I’ve had almost every one. Just today my phone froze and shut off which, also, never happened before. I’m not sure if i just got a wonky one or what. I’m an iPhone lover and I have to have the latest one but I’m a little disappointed with this release. It’s very similar to the last phone.",4,2019-11-02 02:55:00
"57","Fancy. I had a 6S and this is a major improvement","This phone is bigger in every way. Sound, feel, weight, power, battery life. Great stuff.

"58","Phone that is at first a phone","If you want a phone that you can access voicemail, depend on applications not crashing and have the fastest phone tested to be faster than even the new Snapdragon 855 chipsets, this is the phone. It will not overheat, it will not crash and you get your phone and voicemail with some sense of privacy. Nothing new here, if you have one already though you only get a better camera.",5,2019-10-04 20:11:00
"59","Best iPhone ever","I’ve been buying iPhones since the 3G model back in 2008. If you are a fan of iOS or Apple products in general this one doesn’t disappoint. I moved from an iPhone X to this one and feel it is worth the upgrade. The camera is excellent, the OLED screen is fantastic. Watching HDR video is like watching one of the LG OLED 4K TVs.",5,2019-10-25 16:25:00
"60","Amazing new iPhone","Absolutely love the distinctive new design and the new cameras! Battery life is also significantly better compared to the iPhone XS max. Overall a great upgrade.

"61","The best !","Traded in my pixel 3 and best decision I’ve made. The battery last forever and the camera is so good.",5,2020-02-02 08:58:00
"62","Great Camera","The updates on the camera make me feel, and the end product look, like the pictures are taken professionally.  The portrait option has just gotten better and gets better with every upgrade in IOS.  It’s an Apple product so I wouldn’t expect anything but the best, especially for the price that is paid, but it is worth every penny.",5,2019-10-18 23:45:00
"63","BEST iPhone YET!!","I had to replace my iPhone 6 Plus and went with the latest and best iPhone.  Very thin, excellent design and picture taking is great.  Will recommend for anyone.",5,2020-01-06 16:32:00

"65","Best iPhone yet!!!","I decided to get a new phone on release day, and I am so happy!  The phone itself has great battery life, a wonderful screen and the camera is just unbelievable.  The camera is so good that I now regret lugging around an expensive mirrorless rig.  I took a shot of a sunset that blows people away, especially when I tell them it’s from my iPhone.",5,2019-10-11 19:39:00
"66","Super","I love the new iphone 11 pro max. The picture quality is amazing. Night shots look as if they were taken in daytime. Everything is super clear on it. I thought the iphone X was pretty good until I got the chance to see the difference the 11 makes. There is a learning curve with the 11. It's not cheap but the trade-in made it more affordable.",5,2019-10-12 02:10:00
"67","very fast","first time I have a Max or big iPhone, I was more incline to the small phones specially since I carry them in my pockets and run with it...
but lately start to do many thing in my phone almost not use the iPad any more, since the phone is at hand always.. chose this one .. no disappointment .",5,2019-11-02 13:38:00
"68","The camera is phenomenal","This is the best iPhone yet, the camera is fast enough to capture my adorable impatient toddler!",5,2020-01-31 15:15:00
"69","Amazing Phone","Amazing phone but I will never buy another phone online from Best Buy. Finally got the phone to work today after calling Verizon and waiting on hold 40 min. All the iPhone 11s Best Buy had we’re set for the wrong Activation date 5 days later. I love Best Buy but this was a terrible Experience. Had I traded in my phone I would not have had a working phone for days!!!!",5,2019-09-27 18:13:00
"70","Bought the first day","I had been waiting anxiously for this release.  I bought it the first day at Best Buy. No wait and no line.  It has met my expectations so far.",5,2019-09-28 15:25:00
"71","If you need a larger screen this is it","I wanted a larger phone and have been using apple devices for a while.  It's heavier than the older, smaller phones but if you know IOS there is not much else to say.  The new cameras take excellent pictures and video.  It's too soon to comment on battery life, but like the other phones I've had this is a solid device.",5,2019-10-17 16:48:00
"72","Another amazing device from Apple","Upgraded from the X Max and don’t regret it one bit! The camera is unlike any camera that has graced the iPhone. Battery life is definitely an improvement from last years model (my biggest reason for wanting to upgrade). Love the midnight green coloring. Like always, apple has created a gorgeous device that works seamlessly with the IOS software.",5,2019-10-04 16:50:00
"73","Great new features","My husband was having problems with his IPhone 6 keeping a charge. But new batteries would not get him new features and a better camera . He loves his new iPhone 11 ProMax. The pictures are terrific . It is so easy to use. Still learning all of the new features. So glad for the “11”.",5,2019-11-02 15:09:00
"74","Do not regret this purchase","Really cannot speak highly enough about this phone. Finally switched over from years of Android OS phones. Everything, from the watch and the AirPods, works so flawlessly with one another comparative to Android based systems. Not quite as customizable as Android, but it’s worth the sacrifice, in my opinion.",5,2019-10-18 15:53:00
"75","Excellent upgrade","Camera is fantastic really leaving little to no need for a dslr camera.  Phone is big but manageable.  iOS 13 has some upgrades that are advantageous such as night shots.  Overall the price is high and not necessarily worth spending that much each year but last phone was iPhone 6S+ so this is an excellent upgrade.",5,2019-10-13 10:17:00
"76","Very Beautiful Phone","At first when I saw all the photos of the phone online, I feared that I wouldn’t like the design. But when you get the phone and look at it in person it’s beautiful. Other than a few iOS 13 glitches, the phone overall is wonderful. The camera is as amazing as advertised. If you have an older iPhone and you’re looking to upgrade, this phone is a good choice.",5,2019-09-22 12:13:00
"77","A week in, it's performing as advertised.","A week in, the pricey device is performing as advertised--fast, crisp graphics, and even a slowfie / slofie shot taken for kicks and giggles turned out like I gather a slowfie / slofie should.  Still getting used to Face ID (not a fingerprint) opening up apps and saving passwords, but I'm optimistic that'll become second nature soon enough.",5,2019-09-28 07:48:00
"78","Great phone","I wasn’t planning on getting a new phone but was impressive with the oled screen. I’m not a fan of the bigger phones so I preferred the max. Don’t waste your money on 64gb. Pay up and get the extra storage. You are gonna want to use this phone for what it’s built for: high quality videos and photos. Video games",5,2019-10-11 20:34:00
"79","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Let me say I, along with my family, are Apple people. With 4 iPhones, 3 MacBook Pros, three iPads, and an Airport Time Capsule, we like Apple. As for the newest iPhone 11 Pro, not so good. The screen and camera are great, when they work correctly. IOS 13 has been plagued with issues since receiving the phone. I’m sure Apple is active in correcting the issues, but personally I believe they released it too soon. Due to the issues I’ve had, sadly I can’t recommend it as of yet. Any phone is only as good as it’s operating system, which sadly hasn’t been that great...",4,2019-10-18 15:53:00

The camera has been as advertised - it takes amazing pictures and videos and the widescreen option is a game changer.",5,2019-10-12 10:02:00
"103","Nice upgrade","Camera is the primary reason I upgraded my phone, the camera is super nice although I’m still having to learn what features it has… I did have a little bit of trouble with the screen protector that I ordered, it was blocking a sensor so I thought something was wrong with my phone but it was actually the screen protector. The man at the Apple store just recommended that I not even use one since the glass is so strong.The only reason for four stars instead of five is the cost is somewhat ridiculous. What you get though, it was expected.",4,2019-10-13 14:44:00
"104","Great Phone!","Lightning fast processor.  Plus easy to use camera for beginners but with many sophisticated features for the more advanced users.

"105","Awesome phone","Awesome phone The cameras really nice the pictures come out awesome",5,2020-01-31 16:51:00
"106","Really it's just another iphone","I read these reviews and see a very common theme in what's been left forbothers to read, "" great upgrade"", "" love the new features especially the camera"". Let's be really honest here it's the exact same phone that has came out over the last 3 years, pretty much since the ""limited edition"" iPhone x, which ended up not being limited at all and became the current apple standard. It's what to expect from apple, luxury build quality great display, Thanks Samsung!! Or LG for the cheaper models. The only difference really is the cameras which is only catching up to what the Google pixel kicked off with the low light phenomena bringing crystal clear pics in the darkest settings apple of course dumps every high end part available right down to the screws I'm sure are dipped in unicorn sweat just because why not as for a great upgrade not really at all if you bought a iPhone in the last 2 years save your money your not missing anything at all except the capability not to upgrade to iOS 13, there some pretty major flaws and privacy concerns surrounding this build so if your one of the smart ones who hasn't upgrade I would continue not to if I where you at least for a few months when all the security issues are patched that being said in display touch id, 5g and sure to be revolutionary camera upgrades are all to come in the iPhone 12 and from what I've heard and read there's some really exciting groundbreaking and a complete build overhaul coming so if coming from say iPhone 8 then this is for you iPhone X and up hang on to your cash after all this will be obsolete in 6 months by apples standards at least hold off for the next round because 1500 dollars plus for a couple camera upgrades and USB C charging finally is not worth the cost of a decent car",3,2019-10-04 23:20:00
"107","Best of the best","Picked this up for the wife.  She wasn’t planning on upgrading this year, but after using mine and seeing the photo quality from the cameras she decided she needed one as well",5,2019-12-06 15:17:00

The pictures it takes are stellar!  Better than any camera I have owned (Nikon, EOS Rebel, etc). No longer need a camera if you have an iPhone 11 Pro Max.  The battery life is great. I upgraded from an iPhone 6 Plus and find the face recognition along with a bigger screen to be a great feature. Apple made it super easy/seamless to migrate from my iPhone 6, everything transferred wirelessly. I'm also loving the swipe keys feature and all the other new updates now that iOS 13 is stable.

If you are traveling out of country for the first 60 days you must be satisfied with your carriers international plan (At least Verizon ) the phone is locked so you will not be able to use the eSim or other Sim for the 60 days.

The wide and telephoto lens work so well and make pictures look great. Night mode also works great and the pictures I have taken in low light look awesome. 

The OLED screen is so brilliant. I have watched Youtube and movies I have in 4K on the phone. They look terrific and the ohone has Dolby Atmos sound. Great experience!

I also love the size. It is almost too big for my pockets, but I don't care because the size is perfect for using the phone, and there is more space to see the images and videos and websites on the phone.

I have not found a negative point in the new iPhone 11 Pro Max.

"686","Microphone and camera issues","This is a beautiful phone in the midnight green but comes at a price. There are quirks that have no fix right now. While using the speaker, or Bluetooth in the car, the sound is like an echo with airplane noises. I’ve tried everything and the only thing that helps is to turn the volume down very low but then I can’t hear my caller. The camera utilizes widescreen on the back camera so while FaceTiming, the other person sees distortion of plus Yiu can see pixels as you move the phone around. Lastly, it took five hours to get service at the store. It took a Samsung expert to help the manager by suggesting to swap out the new SIMS card, which was defective. Unless you get this phone on sale, which I did, I would wait to see if the microphone and widescreen distortion gets fixed. Not a happy camper and thinking of returning within the 14-day exchange since I feel this phone is defective.",1,2019-12-06 16:29:00

"705","If you want a good Smartphone go Android","I've had this phone for just over a month so I feel like I've had enough time to really give a fair judgement: The phone is fine. It's a good smartphone and does what a smartphone is intended. 

But my god does this phone feel like such a drag after using android and pixel. 

The camera quality on my two year old pixel is way better than this new iphone and it was able to do more. This iphone camera feels very limiting. The pictures are sub-par quality. They're fine if you take casual photos but if you're trying to take something nice then forget it. 

It had trouble with wifi no matter where I'm at. In fact it seems like Wifi only slows it down! I had the same issue the last time I had an iphone so at this point I think it's an apple problem. 

I could go on but there is just almost no quality in this phone where an android or pixel isn't better. 

And then the price is ridiculous! You pay more for a phone that's just okay. 

If you want to get your money's worth then go for the samsung galaxy or google pixel. Not only are they usually cheaper but they are loads better and can do more. At this point iphone is more of a fashion accessory or status symbol.",3,2019-11-27 08:49:00
"706","Love it!","Size is great. Camera awesome!  Midnight Green looks more like gray. Color is not vibrant but the user does not look at the back much anyway. So fast, easy to find what I need. Keeps charge so well!",5,2019-11-16 08:14:00

"719","Huge Upgrade","I didn’t realize how much of the scene was missing from my pictures until I started using the ultra wide camera lens. It should come standard on all flagships! The camera system is absolutely amazing. I am really impressed with Night Mode. The OLED display is stunning, and I love Dark Mode in iOS 13! I thought I would miss Burst Mode, but I think I like taking Slofies more. I also like the added ability to adjust settings within Apple’s Camera app. Despite all the complaints about iOS 13, I have had very few problems, much less than I did with any of the Android smartphones I had a few years ago. The only major thing I don’t like about iPhones is the high price.",5,2020-01-01 13:24:00

I love the size of my 11 Pro Max, the quality of the camera, the speaker phone works great and I dearly love the 512 GB storage and the large size of the screen!  I don’t miss touching the button at the bottom, you just swipe upwards on the line (same thing!).  
When Best Buy had this phone on sale for a Christmas sale, I ordered it immediately!  Verizon sale was buy one/get one (a lesser phone), but I did not need 2 phones/2 lines and the 1st phone was full price.  Best Buy was there for me again!!",5,2020-01-04 04:14:00
"722","The best phone on the market.","Absolutely incredible phone. This really seems like the greatest upgrade Apple has ever done on an iPhone compared to its predecessor. I traded in my iPhone XS Max and the iPhone 11 Pro Max completely blows it away. The new camera system is impeccable. The battery is superb, speed unreal, and the overall quality and performance is unmatched. Well done, Apple, well done.",5,2020-01-02 23:34:00

I love the cameras, they take excellent pictures.",5,2020-01-10 19:19:00
"725","Camera and face ID -- absolutely grand!","It's your top of the line iPhone mostly carried forward from the past. The great advances over the X(10) which we kept in the family are the camera upgrade and face ID. Camera lives up to the hype: much better opticals along with more photo and video picture taking options, plus more editing options. Face ID is amazing. Reads your face at almost any angle.",5,2019-12-21 10:02:00
"726","Decent Upgrade","I wasn’t looking to upgrade but family member wanted to buy my Xs Max from me so sold it and bought the 11 Pro Max.  Biggest improvement for me is the battery.  I’ve used it for the last two days without a charge and I still have 56%.  The screen is also a decent improvement with better whites, blacks and brightness.  As for the camera, I guess if you take a lot of pictures then it’s worth an upgrade but if your like me who uses it more for work...I wouldn’t upgrade.  The three lenses on the back make it look weird and prefers the previous two lenses.",4,2020-01-03 15:52:00
"727","Smart, Handy, and Fun to use.","Upgrading from the iPhone 8 plus to the iPhone 11 Pro Max was a no brainer. I enjoy the convenience of unlocking the screen with Facial recognition.

"756","BB Customer Service was great about screen issue!","I'm a huge fan of Apple products, and a long-time owner of a succession of iPhones.  A lot more expensive than other brands, but the quality has always been worth it.  The durability has allowed me to ""live life"" without worrying about breakage resulting from normal, everyday use.  

I'm always very mindful of how I handle my electronics, and NEVER careless; vigilant but not paranoid.  Do I toss it in my pocketbook?  Of course!  Do I put it in the back pocket of my jeans once in a while?  Who doesn't?   

With no change in my day-to-day use, in 4 days, the screen of this ""11"" had a couple of fractures!  It was not dropped, and nothing hit it; nor did anything scratch or gouge it.  I immediately went back to BB to discuss the issue, and it was resolved with an exchange and the recommendation of a tempered glass screen protector.  I did get the screen protector for the replacement iPhone, and it's a good thing I did...  I’ve already had to replace that, yesterday, for the same problem:  unexplained fracture.  (This time the iPhone screen ""survived."")

Apparently this model is the first one that can't be popped in my back pocket for a few minutes to free up my hands.  I believe it's a design flaw and I'll be watching to see if this is noted as a common occurrence.  While I love everything else about it, this would be one concern in ""recommending"" it.  

Best Buy, regarding the required yes/no answer regarding recommendation, there should be a third option: ""unsure.""",3,2019-10-10 07:41:00

I have the 256 GB  and I don’t think I will ever run out of room. There is so many features on this phone if I keep it for 10 years I will probably find something new.

"804","iPhone 11 pro","The only complaint I have about this amazing piece of technology is it is heavy. I’m just not use to the size difference from my old iphone 6s to this massive device. It is hard to hold for long period of time, if you like watching Netflix or other shows on your phone... invest in a stand.",5,2020-01-18 13:50:00
"805","What a beautiful phone","Has a large bright, crisp display and lots of features. Particularly love the Hey Siri feature to send messages, make phone calls, go to apps, etc. You do need to get some type of cover for it ( I did order one) as the uncovered phone is thin and lightweight and somewhat slick to hold onto - I'd hate to drop this beauty.",5,2020-01-02 10:58:00
"806","I'm impressed","Just switched from the Galaxy family. Never used an iPhone before and it is very easy now that you can use the SWIPE keyboard. My only 2 complaints are that it is not 5G and it is very expensive, but I knew that before I ought it.",5,2020-01-24 15:31:00
"807","Great Camera!!!","The night photo option is amazing! It comes out ridiculously Clear!!",4,2019-11-15 17:08:00
"808","Best of the Best","As always the iPhone's are overpriced but Pro max is the right size screen for my aging eyes. Screen resolution is phenomenal and this year's bionic chip is blazing fast. Did I mention battery life? The best ever on an iPhone and for me the most important feature. STRONGLY RECOMMEND if your wallet can afford it or you get it on sale.",5,2019-12-15 06:16:00
"809","Amazing camera quality!","I had the 10 XS Max previously. They are both extremely similar. The only difference is the camera quality. The iPhone 10's camera quality is still amazing but there is just a very very very small difference.",5,2020-01-24 16:25:00
"810","Great new features","I love the new features. The camera is amazing and I have adjusted quickly. It took some time to get used to not having the thumb button but the facial IF is much easier to use when accessing my phone.",5,2020-01-25 14:25:00
"811","Switched to iPhone 11 Pro Max from Old Samsung","I'm extremely happy with my new iPhone, although I am certainly still learning to use all its features.  I highly recommend this particular model; I am a senior citizen and appreciate the ease of use and especially the size of the screen.  Highly recommend!",5,2020-01-03 18:41:00
"812","Great camera but still an iphone","Camera is awesome but any new updates that you download , as usual,  slows your phone down upgrade after upgrade. $1400 to last possibly two years.",3,2020-01-11 18:27:00
"813","LOVE","As a long time iPhone user, this is a great evolution from previous generations. 

If you go for the Max, keep in mind that it is pretty big. If you have small hands it may be hard to hold. The camera though is truly incredible. 

Def recommend!",5,2020-01-03 16:30:00
"814","Great Phone","I am really happy i popped for this phone over the iPhone 11 or iPhone 11 Pro. The phone's size is just right for me and makes everything easy to read. Still pictures and videos are outstanding - the improved stabilization on this phone is outstanding.",5,2019-12-28 10:47:00
"815","11 pro max","So far I’m loving the cameras ! They pick up all the true colors and I am blown away by the quality.. the phone itself took a little bit of getting used to since I was coming from an iPhone 7plus..",5,2020-01-10 19:55:00
"816","The price is completely worth it!","I really like the interface in this phone. They made it so easy to use with many shortcuts that really improve the consumer experience. The camera is great for people that care about the quality but not enough to buy a professional camera.",5,2019-12-20 15:18:00
"817","Simply the best iPhone to date.","It is fast, great battery life, super sharp screen with very realistic color rendition. Best phone camera I’ve ever used.  What else can you say.  This replaced my 5 yr old iPhone 6.",5,2020-01-12 17:53:00
"818","Perfect Apple","Nothing negative about this. Not a HUGE difference in daily use is noticed from the Xs Max. If you’re looking to upgrade you’ll be satisfied.

"827","Very good camera, same size footprint of iPhone 7+","I wasn’t expecting to be already happy to have upgraded but I am pleasantly surprised. The one drawback I can say is the new swiping motion compared to pre iPhone X.",5,2019-12-27 15:30:00
"828","Great phone! Fast and easy to use.","My first Iphone! I thought the Samsung S10 + was the best ever. I purchased this phone for a specific app developed to work blu-tooth with new hearing aids. The app is great and the phone is amazing.",5,2019-12-06 17:22:00
"829","Enjoy every aspect of this phone.","I splurged and purchased the top of the line iPhone. Traded in my 6s. I enjoy the Face ID; is so much more simple and quick. Battery life is outstanding.",5,2019-12-28 09:14:00

"835","Camera upgrade","Not much different beside the camera from my XS max it’s heavier which is a minus. If you’re upgrading from an 8 or lower this will be an awesome phone, if not it’s just the battery and camera that’s different. But I will say the camera is pretty phenomenal and the battery lasts a while, which is why I gave 4 stars!",4,2019-12-27 15:52:00
"836","Very Nice Phone!","I bought this for my wife moving her from an iPhone 7 Plus.  Photos are amazing and the fidelity of her voice when we talk is like she is in the room with me!  Great phone!",5,2019-12-14 14:06:00

"842","Great camera on this phone","I’m still learning all the features after having traded in my iPhone 6S Plus. It takes a little getting used to not having a home button. It’s all about the swiping. The clarity on the iPhone 11 Pro Max is amazing.",5,2019-11-12 20:40:00
"843","Easy to use","Love it.  Don’t know why I waited so long to get rid of the button. The 11Pro Max is so much easier to use and the cameras are great!",5,2019-12-27 17:08:00

"847","Nice wide angle camera","Better camera than the X. Now I don’t ever have a need for my old camera, unless I need to really zoom in from distance.",5,2019-12-30 15:12:00
"848","iPhone 11 Pro Max.","Nice big screen with an efficient camera setup. iPhone works similar to other owned iPhones. Biggest difference is the screen size.",5,2019-12-23 21:59:00

"851","Camera on phone","Best camera easy to use better than your own eyes. Worth the money",5,2020-01-28 07:09:00
"852","Bring back the thumbprint scanner","I traded in an 8Plus for the 11 Pro Max. Functionally, there is very little difference between the two. The camera on the 11 is definitely better (but the 8Plus was really good anyway), the battery lasts longer and the fast charger is good.  Speedwise it a little slicker but not by much. My gripe with this phone is the facial recognition. It is inconvenient and aggravating. You really have to get the right angle to be recognized, and if you pick up your phone a lot, having to swipe and hold the phone to your face only to have to type in the passcode or reswipe again, becomes aggravating and wears on you. Also, if you wear sunglasses, you need to remove them for it to work.  Extremely inconvenient. The thumbprint scanner was solid and almost never failed.  This is a great phone in almost all respects, but the inconsistent facial recognition performance is enough to knock not just one but two stars off for me.  In hindsight, I wish I had kept my 8Plus and waited for something better down the road. Save your money and wait for something better.",3,2019-11-19 08:36:00
"853","Great camera love facial recognition","I was reluctant to buy a new phone because of the hassle of 
data transfer.  It was a snap to mirror my old phone to the new
Apple pro 11 max in minutes. This is a NICE phone!!",5,2019-11-23 13:43:00
"854","Loving it!","Like the large screen as I have eyesight problems. It allows easier reading of the screen and so I can increase the font and read books",5,2019-12-15 23:03:00

"958","Apple you disappoint me every-tim i want to switch","i don't want to complain much but i am disappointed with apple iphone , they have not changed anything since i had my last iPhone . The most annoying feature is when u cannot receive text messages when u are driving or receiving calls, yes it is something u can fix through the app but this is just plain stupid - too many restrictions camera is ok . For a basic iphone 64gb i trade it in to a Samsung galaxy note 10plus u can multitask and comes with 256gb memory 12gb of ram it completely destroys iphone in terms of specs 4gb or ram and 64gm memory - Come on apple wake up and restructure your business. Perfect example it took me 45 minutes to transfer data from galaxy note 9 to iphone and 2 min to transfer data from iPhone to Samsung galaxy note 10 plus. For business i would def use Samsung hands down.",2,2020-01-17 15:22:00

"974","Windows Phone Was SOO Much Better","I've been using Windows Phone for years.  Finally made the change to iPhone.  It feels like I've gone back in time by 5 years!  My phone is no longer a ""smart"" phone, it is an aggravating dumb phone!  iOS is awful at allowing me to use my phone the way I want!  Tried getting custom ringtones, and that was a grueling ordeal.  Tried downloading files to the phone and it was a nightmare.  Calendar doesn't work as well as Windows Phone, Contacts on iPhone are a nightmare mess of a disaster with no rhyme or reason to the photo associated with them. My wife told me to stop thinking logically and just feel good about my phone.  That's the Apple experience in a nutshell.

The phone itself is nice hardware, but my screen cracked after 3 days while the phone was in my pocket!  Not my back pocket, in my front pocket!  Forbes wrote an article about this problem with the iPhone 11 models.  I tried taking it back for exchange but Best Buy refused to take it. They said I had to buy Apple Care for $200 then pay another $30 to have the screen fixed.  On a $1,200 phone that is less than a week old.

The battery life is incredible on this phone.  Lasts 4 days between charging.  Charging takes about 1-2 hours.

iOS is almost catching up to Windows (5 years late).  It finally has a built in swipe keyboard, and it finally has dark mode.  But most things I try to do with iOS are more like I'm fighting and battling my phone rather than the phone helping me.  Don't even bother trying to get all your photos to display in the photos app... I have to go to each separate app like OneDrive or iCloud to see photos in each location.  Windows Phone was so much better in almost every way... I can't comprehend why people settled for this inferior clunky pain in the neck OS on their phones.",1,2019-12-27 10:36:00

"978","Camera is very blurry!","The camera is definitely a downgrade from the iPhone XS Max! The Apple Music seems to not work at certain times and the phone struggles to connect to the wifi",1,2019-12-20 15:15:00
"979","Worst IPHONE EVER!!!!!!","The IPHONE 11 Pro Max is the worst phone I have ever had.
I have had IPhones for 20 years and this is the worst.  Cant get calls and make calls.  Drops calls all the time.  I have spent two (2) afternoons at Apple store and still have a terrible problem.  Phone doesnt even show that people have called. ( no missed calls) 
APPLE NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING AS I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS THIS PROBLEM.",1,2019-11-21 19:17:00
