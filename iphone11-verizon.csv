"1","Great product for a first time Apple user","I've never owned an Apple product but this year I took the plunge to move from Android (Pixel phones, Samsung phones) to get this iPhone 11. It was the right time for me to do so. With the changes and improves iOS13 brings (from all that I've read and watched in reviews/vids) and the camera upgrades from XR; the transition has been fairly easy. I know there is a learning curve for me as I slowly learn the iOS system. But I changed to have the best of both worlds. And it is true the Google apps in iOS do run better than on Android.

The phone performance has been stellar. NO lag. NO freezes. I had prepared myself to have a smooth experience with iOS, but I have still been surprised and pleased with the fluidity. Never have I experienced anything so smooth on any of the many Android phones I've used over the years. The battery is a superstar champ. It feels as if I cannot kill it if I were to try. Even though I am never far from a charging option, it is so refreshing to not feel battery anxiety.

Siri is WAY better than I was led to believe. In fact I find her to be more responsive and less buggy than Google Assistant - especially when using Apple CarPlay. This was a surprise to me due to all I've read. Voice to text is admittedly not as accurate as Assistant. 

I already knew the iPhone cameras take the best videos, but the updates to the photos themselves are phenomenal. The auto night mode is fantastic - I like it better than Pixel's Night Sight. It seems more natural. True the Portraits are sometimes not as well defined as on the Pixel phones - but that is something that is not a game changer for me. I like the fact that photos on the iPhone 11 are not over sharpened as is true on the Pixel lineup (I've had all 3 Pixel phones so I'm not spinning my wheels here).

True tone is fantastic. The color (mint green) is the prettiest color I've had on a phone. I have no issues with the LCD screen versus OLED - it's a great screen. The gestures are great and smooth and easy to learn. 

I've been so pleased with this that I'm not looking at (researching) buying one of the Macbook laptops (tablets are not for me). 

This is a fantastic phone. No looking back.",5,2019-10-06 11:43:00
"2","Very good phone and camera","High quality phone that still has about 50 % charge at the end of the day. Very good camera especially if you edit with Camera+.",5,2019-10-18 18:21:00
"3","Bought 2","Wife needed one bought her and I one. Love low light camera function",5,2019-12-07 08:13:00
"4","Love it","I’m already an iPhone user for many years. But really impressed with how much easier it is. Camera is much better. Longer battery life! Much more memory! Love it!!!",5,2020-01-18 17:46:00
"5","Amazing pics and footage!","Love my new iPhone 11! It’s fast and the camera is amazing. Video quality is excellent.",5,2020-01-03 16:22:00
"6","Great phone for the price","This review is based on upgrading from an iPhone X to an 11, hopefully it helps those who are in the same situation. 
There were a few reasons I chose to upgrade, I wanted a slightly bigger screen, I wanted better battery life, and I wanted better speed (I play quite a bit of games on my phone). I had also made the mistake of getting an X with only 64gb which was a bad idea to begin with. This phone fortunately covers all those issues. The battery life is great and the speed at which this phone opens apps is incredible. The camera with the wide angle is also a big bonus, I’ve never been a big photographer with my phones, but I’ve found myself using this phone a lot more for that purpose.
The one downside to this phone is the quality of the screen, this is more evident with the new dark mode in iOS13. Black screens on this phone aren’t really black, they’re more of a dark grey and this is due to the OLED vs LCD screen.
I still own my X and once I upgraded it to iOS13 I could see the difference in dark mode, on my X the black backgrounds seem truly black while on the 11 the blacks seem a little lighter. Does this make the upgrade not worth it? I guess it depends how much the lighter blacks bother you. Personally, after a month of use I don’t notice it much anymore.
At $749 for the 128gb I would highly recommend this phone, if the LCD screen bothers you that much then I would recommend going for the Pro but at the price point I’m not sure extra deep blacks are worth it.",5,2019-10-21 13:03:00
"7","Fantastic upgrade","Upgraded to the 11, 128gb from an 8+ 256gb. Never needed 256 with the 8+ But that was the next size up from 64gb. 128gb is perfect. I’m able to keep all of my photos and all of my music on this phone with 60+gb left. A lot of talk about how the pro screen is so much better than the 11’s LCD screen. But going from the 8+ that already had an LCD, this screen seems sharper and more vibrant. The thing that really stands out is the speed. This thing just flies. I can click a link or open a new app and it loads almost as quickly as snapping your fingers. The camera on the 8+ was already pretty good, but again the 11 shines better here. I love the wide angle lense and the night mode. I used to hate taking low-light pics due to the flash making things seem so white. What I like most is gaining some screen size compared to my 8+, but in a smaller form factor. Overall I am extremely satisfied with my upgrade and would definitely do it again. For most people, the iPhone 11 is the upgrade that is worth every penny!",5,2019-09-22 16:19:00
"8","A screen I can see without the bulk of a PLUS","I left a 7 for this 11. It gives me a visual screen that I can see without the bulk of the iPhone 7+ which my husband is very happy with. 

It’s taken a bit to get the hang of it but I had excellent help getting started with the help of Joshua in the mobile department. Later I went back in to my geek Michael who went step by step through the questions that had cropped up. 

If you haven’t used anything past iPhone 8 be sure to play around and make a list of what you’re stuck on. Take it to mobile or geek squad. If it’s easier, call Apple. 

Enjoy your new iPhone!!!

Very important to me is that this phone doesn’t have the OLED screen. I’m extremely light sensitive and get migraines. This is the only phone I can use. If Apple  switches to all OLED screens in the future I’m off iPhone.",5,2019-09-27 15:30:00
"9","Amazing camera","The only thing that really sperates phones these days seems to be the cameras. I had a pixel 2 xl (now on galaxy s10e) which takes the best pictures. My wife bought the iPhone 11 and I am thinking about switching to it. The camera is AMAZING. Battery life is great and the new iOS adds a lot of shortcuts that apple was missing. For 699 apple hit a home run with this phone. Even tho the screen is lower resolution the colors and brightness are astounding. I'm not an Apple fan but may be...I just haven't switched yet because I still love Android but I'm on the fence.",5,2019-10-13 09:22:00
"10","Best iPhone to this day! Right size right price.","The iPhone 11 is an amazing phone. I had a XS Max before, and traded it in to get this, and I am so happy I did. This is what I consider the “Goldilocks” iPhone; it’s just right. The size, both screen and body, is perfect, being in between the 11 Pro and Pro Max. It’s not as good a screen as the Pro’s OLED, but it’s still pretty darn good. The colors are amazing and it still is a very high-definition screen. Why spend extra for a better screen? You’re getting the same processor, which is wicked fast, and ALL the same features as the Pro! I am so glad that I switched from the XS Max because I can enjoy all of the same great features of the Pro model for a fraction of the cost. I would HIGHLY recommend considering buying the 11 over the Pro series.",4,2019-09-29 17:16:00
"11","Love it! It’s easy to use. Nice!","Not a big stretch from my previous iPhone as far as understanding how to use the functionality. I’m happy with this phone. Thanks WBHauser",5,2020-01-17 19:22:00
"12","I phones  keep getting better","Started off with a iPhone 4 then thru the years kept upgrading up to the new iPhone 11.  I really must say the iphone 11 knock it out of the park!  Very user friendly and easily adaptable even for the beginner. Battery life is alot better then my previous phones. Thank you iPhone and Bestbuy.",5,2019-10-13 10:41:00
"13","This was a pre order","I’m sure this is a great phone but I cancelled it the very next day when I discovered the 128gb was only $50 more. I could easily have stayed with the 64gb since I only used 32gb of my 128gb iPhone 7. It’s just that I got used to the security of having plenty of space. 

I ordered the red (instead of the purple that I really like) because 100% goes to fighting Aids. I will always choose a product that supports a charity.",5,2019-09-20 16:48:00
"14","my first iphone","this  is my first iphone, been a samsung owner since the S4 came out, it's a great phone, love how it picks up wifi where ever i am, no signing in to networks. i got the 11 because i'm a photographer, it's all about the camera for me. my 2 issues is the volume, on phone calls i have to put on speaker phone,just to see if i'm connecting with my caller, i'm still learning how to navigate thru out, also the photos are out of order when transferred over, but pairs well with my car.  pros and cons like everything.",5,2020-01-26 11:02:00
"15","Amazed","I have had the 8 plus in red for 2 years but I was the  lucky One and got a defective device it didn’t happen after the first year was over and I was debating on the 11 or 11 pro and after finally deciding on the 11 I don’t see much of a difference except a little more screen and extra camera but I love my red iPhone 11 best decision and of course Best Buy is the way to go when starting a contract or upgrading they always look for deals and with a lower phone payment",5,2019-12-06 15:35:00
"16","Good Phone","I was impressed by how well the content transferred from my old Iphone to the new one, it even captured my folders on the screen and the open internet windows I had.  I stayed onsite at Best Buy and they helped me get things going.  They also price matched a phone case for me which saved me time and energy ordering it from elsewhere. 

the only struggle I had was transferring my applewatch content to the new phone, my husband had to back it up on a desktop and reset some things before the apple watch would recognize the new phone.",5,2020-01-03 16:15:00
"17","Terrific phone","I’m totally impressed with this new I-phone 11. I was a dedicated Blackberry owner for 20 years! Now I’m wondering what took me so long to switch. At 72 years old I have mastered iOS 13 in a little more than one day! It is so incredibly friendly. I love it.",5,2019-09-27 15:24:00
"18","So many reasons this was a great gift","My son had issues with his old phone and the thought of not being able to get a hold of each other at any time was upsetting to both of us. His old phone likely could have been repaired, but there was no guarantee. It made sense to buy a new phone and know that he not only had something reliable, but also something that had better features and more storage than his previous phone. He loved it and I love knowing that he appreciates the new phone as well.",5,2020-01-18 14:44:00
"19","Impressive New Version of the iPhone","I had been using an iPhone 6s for several years but was having issues with battery life, the charging port, etc. so I decided it was time to update. I debated buying an older model rather than the iPhone 11 to avoid the use of Face ID but decided to go with the most recent model and think that was the right decision. The battery life is fantastic in comparison to my old phone, the picture quality is great and I am enjoying the slightly larger screen. I have still not turned on Face ID but may do so eventually which reduces the ease of use somewhat in comparison to the old thumbprint ID.",4,2020-01-03 16:37:00
"20","Great new phone","I’m still getting used to my new iPhone 11 because it’s quite a bit different from my iPhone 6S Plus. I loved that phone but am starting to love my new iPhone 11 as well. I really like the red color to start with, but also all the new features, such as face recognition, swiping from one screen to the next & the camera takes really clear & pretty photos. There are many other options that I’m still learning, but overall I really like my new phone & would highly recommend it.",5,2020-01-10 16:36:00
"21","Nice upgrade!","I've had an Apple 6+ iPhone for years and finally decided to purchase an upgrade to iPhone 11.  It's a really nice phone and the new features are cool. I wish these phones weren't so expensive but the quality and security this phone provides helps offset the price for me. I also have a MacBook Pro, so I like that I have 2 Apple products that are easy to sync.",5,2020-02-07 16:20:00
"22","Pretty big compared to iPhone 6","I upgraded from an iPhone 6 to this iPhone 11 which is much larger, does not have the ""button"" to push on the screen (now need to swipe right) and does not allow charging and use of headphones at the same time - both use the same port.  Definitely something to get used to.  Some of my App. passwords transferred over, some did not.  I'm still not sure what the difference is in having 2 cameras instead of one.  Learning curve.",5,2020-01-07 17:15:00
"23","Best iPhone ever!","I moved up from an SE. What a difference!  Facial id makes sign on a breeze. You pick up the phone, look at it and boom you are in. Swoop up and there are your apps. Swoop up again to leave an app. 

Sound is good quality. I haven’t used the headphones so I can’t comment. 

This is the 64 gig model. The case is actually as large as the pro.",5,2020-02-01 00:42:00
"24","Real Nice Upgrade!","Upgrading from a 6, this baby really is nice. Battery life is about twice as long, even after taking advantage of battery replacement on my old 6. Processing speed is astounding, app upgrades are super short. Display is large, bright and sharp. Size was more than I wanted, but it still fits in my front pocket. I thought the loss of the home button was going to be problematic, but in a few hours of use I was completely comfortable with swiping up. So much so that I get somewhat lost when I have to use my wife’s 7. The camera is much more capable than I need but I’m finding new uses as I discover features. The only downside is they didn’t give it to me for free!",5,2019-10-18 20:48:00
"25","Switched from Android to IOS","I am new to an Apple IOS phone. There is a slight learning curve for a first time purchaser of an Apple product. I like the phone but, there are a few features I dislike. 1. I don't like that if I am away from my phone and receive a text message or phone call I have no way of knowing I have received either because, there isn't a light that will blink to let me know I have missed either. 2. I don't care for the camera to much. I don't see options to change my pictures such as, low lighting mode, panorama, and others I can't think of right now. 3. I don't like that I can not use some apps that I could on my android. 4. I don't like that I have to turn WiFi off each day from the top right corner pull down. Then it tells me it will turn it off until the next day and each day I have to go through that to turn it off.  If I go into settings and turn it off there, I am not able to use my hot spot. For it to be an Apple 11 (yes I know it's not the pro or pro max) you would think it would have more features. However, as I said I am new to Apple and it could just be that I have not figured things out.",4,2019-11-05 16:05:00
"26","Impressive New Version of the iPhone","Bought this for my wife who had been using an iPhone 6s for several years but was having issues with battery life and fuzzy pictures so I decided it was time to update. I debated buying an older model for her rather than the iPhone 11 to avoid the use of Face ID but decided to go with the most recent model and think that was the right decision. The battery life is fantastic in comparison to her old phone, the picture quality is great and she is enjoying the slightly larger screen. She has been using Face ID but has not been thrilled with the functionality in comparison to the old thumbprint ID. She is also having to replace her phone holders due to the larger size.",4,2020-01-06 15:44:00
"27","Flawless","Lightning fast processor. My emails, reports, PDFs, app updates, everything! downloads so quickly. There is nearly zero wait time for apps that I have had to wait between 30 seconds and 2 minutes for my XR that I traded in.

Camera: the HD features of the 11 are pretty much useless if your subject is farther than 8 feet away. Also, depending on the angle of capture, faces of people can appear slanted or warped if they are on the edge of the shot; I understand this is hard to escape, due to the tiny lens creating a “walleye vision” effect just from the light passing through it. Physics is still unarguable, despite our digital prowess.",5,2019-10-21 08:56:00
"28","So far so good","I went from an Android to an IPhone this time around. I was hoping the battery life would be better but not so much. It is a work in progress getting used to the difference in operating systems. The camera is good not much difference my my old phone. Over all pretty good.",4,2019-09-28 06:36:00
"29","Big upgrade from my wife's SE","All works well. Pro tip, take the plastic screen protector from the factory off before trying to call or you and the person you're talking to will be frustrated. All works well, iOS transfer is great for mirroring devices. Camera was actually less clear than expected. Shots seem very grainy and not high quality when sending to other devices with higher resolution screens.",5,2020-01-03 16:48:00
"30","iPhone 11 is a great phone.","I was cautioned before buying it about it not having a ""home"" button. It took me all of two minutes to get used to using the phone without one.  I like everything about this phone.",5,2020-02-28 18:09:00
"31","Second time was the charm","Got an iPhone 11 on Black Friday and for the first time ever in my Apple buying experience, the phone wouldn't work. It couldn't connect for some reason. After the great help at Best Buy, I was given this phone and it's been great ever since. Getting to know the new functions was pretty easy after having a 7 for so long. 

Great phone for a great cause.",5,2019-12-22 11:10:00
"32","This is a very good phone.","My husband and I both bought one of these iPhone 11 phones. I thought this was a vast improvement over my iPhone 7. It seems to be a very easy to work with phone, now I just have to get used to IOS 13. I wish to commend both Terrell and Adrienne for the great jobs they did for us at the Verizon desk. I think they are a great asset for the Best Buy store in Mishawaka Indiana store.",5,2019-10-01 08:15:00
"33","The sweet spot in the iPhone line up","I, like another reviewer, traded in an iPhone XS Max for the iPhone 11. No regrets! I like the size better, it has a brilliant screen, and saves me $15.00/month on my phone bill. I still have the features of the Pro series that matter to me and paying $400 less for it. All iPhones are great phones and I wouldn’t own anything else but for me the 11 hits all the marks for my needs at a reasonable price. If you’re on the fence about upgrading to the iPhone 11, go for it! You won’t regret it. It’s a great device!",5,2019-10-25 17:49:00
"34","So far , so good.","Present for my son.  His old phone needed a serious upgrafe... so we went for it.  iphone 11.  He loves it! And going to Best Buy instead of going to our carrier... EXCELLENT!  Our Best Buy Rep was knowledgeable & honest... and it only took 20 minutes... seriously only 20 minutes.  We would have been at our carrier for 2 hours.  Ha!",5,2019-12-21 07:38:00
"35","Unlocked and Best Buy is the way to go.","Bought a unlocked iPhone 11 from Best Buy.  The wireless rep was helpful and very quick in helping me add the phone to our account and finding the life proof case I wanted.  This is the 3rd unlocked phone we have purchased through Best Buy.  Highly recommend Best Buy for all your wireless needs.",5,2020-01-04 10:40:00
"36","Great batter life!","This is my first iPhone and I love it so far. The battery life is much better than my google pixel. I do wish iPhones were a little more customizable, however that’s something I will get used to. I also love the night mode camera; it works super well!",5,2019-09-27 18:54:00
"37","Much needed upgrade","The new iPhone 11 net every expectation and more for a holiday gift for my daughter. The sales associates knowledge and understanding of the product made the purchase even more special by explaining FL the functionality of the phone and upgrades over her previous phone. Win Win",5,2020-01-10 16:16:00
"38","So far so good.","I did purchase the XR and the camera was terrible!  I could not understand how a Pixel 2 could be it.  This double camera seems to be a lot better.  I took a video in 4k, but I cannot watch it in 4k on the phone, a little strange, but OK.  Battery life is FANTASTIC.  The screen is bright.  Having a hard time with the sounds, either too loud or cannot hear it. But I like the phone, like IOS 13 and like the dual speakers on the bottom.",5,2019-11-12 09:42:00
"39","I switched to the dark side","I am not a fan of apple.  However all of my kids have iphones and I was missing out on the interconnectivity that iphones have.  I have to admit that this phone has changed my mind about iPhones.  It wasn't as painful of a switch as I thought it would be.  This is a really nice phone and takes great pictures.",5,2019-12-29 00:19:00
"40","Rough start but a great phone","I had some issues, probably from the IOS 13 bugs restoring this phone from a backup. It froze up, shut down and would not power on. After a visit to BB a tech got it back up running using vol up, vol down and power button combo unfroze the phone. After a couple of IOS 13 updates it works fine. Battery life is incredible! All day of sometime heavy use without a mid day boost. Love the wireless charging, but Apple should throw in a wireless charger rather than making us buy one separately. I huge update from my old iPhone 7.",5,2019-10-11 20:38:00
"41","Still getting used to it","This phone replaced an iPhone 5 that was 6 1/2 years old.  I loved that smaller phone, but the battery was just getting weird.  I would lose 80% of my charge in just five minutes.  This phone probably has way more features than I will ever use.  I'm still getting used to swiping it, instead of hitting a home key.  Sadly, it no longer fits into ""pockets"" in my Baggalini purse, so now it's just in the main compartment.  Therefore, I bought a screen protector because I think it's more vulnerable now.  I also wasn't used to the fact that it turns on automatically whenever you touch it.  I was worried I would wear down the charge.  But I do see the benefit of being able to check the time without clicking anything.    The overall huge benefit is that, since I don't use it much, I don't even have to charge it once a day!  I guess it was just time to say goodbye to my trusty 5!  :-(",4,2019-10-24 13:47:00
"42","Holy Camera","The cameras on the new iPhone 11 is fantastic. Battery life is substantially better than the iPhone X and the speed of apps to launch is in milliseconds. Quite impressed with this update and would recommend to anyone considering upgrading.",5,2019-09-27 17:21:00
"43","Excellent upgrade","This was purchased as a gift for someone upgrading from an iPhone SE so the difference in quality was immediately noticed. All of the new features really made a difference in the user experience. The deal I found through Best Buy got us a better price than directly from either Apple or Verizon. Very pleased.",5,2019-12-23 08:23:00
"44","Another great smartphone from Apple!","I replaced my iPhone 6 with this phone.  I'm very pleased with it so far.  I'm glad I have 64GB of storage now-- I used to have 16.

The only thing I've had to get used to is that this phone is larger in size than than the one I used to have.  Other than that, it's been a very smooth transition.",5,2019-12-28 03:51:00
"45","Like bery much.","Haven’t had a chance to use the camera much but I’m sure it will be really good. So nice not running out of memory. Increased from 16 g with my 6S to 128 gwith my 11.",5,2020-02-19 17:10:00
"46","Best value iPhone!","This is hands down the best iPhone you can buy for your money. It has the same cameras (minus the telephoto) and processors as the 11 Pro! Not to mention it has a super long battery life that lasts all day with constant use!",5,2019-10-04 06:58:00
"47","I am really enjoying my upgrade to iPhone 11.","I was surprised to find a better deal from Best Buy than from my provider for my upgrade from iPhone 6 to iPhone 11. I am loving the upgrade! It was an easy transition. No more error messages telling me to manage my storage before I can take a picture or update my apps.",5,2020-01-03 18:30:00
"48","The sound/camera/battery life is great","Sounds like the speaker is in the back, the new surround sound system in this phone is amazing. This camera is no joke and worth buying if your don’t want to buy an actual camera, portrait mode is awesome. You can play music/be online/Play games and you will still have battery by the time you get home. Very impressed with the new iPhone 11",5,2019-09-21 01:31:00
"49","Fast and beautiful design.","Coming from iPhone 7 Plus (128gbs) the upgrade was definitely big change. I opted for extra storage for additional $$$. I still can't believe Apple refuse to make 128 or 256 as a standard size for $700-$1000 device.

"51","Love this phone. It is fast and has a great camer","This phone has a great camera and it feels great in the hands. It’s a little thicker than the iPhone 8 Plus and I like it better",5,2020-02-28 18:52:00
"52","Awesome phone","I got this phone for my brother for Christmas and so far he loves his phone. He had an iPhone 6 And he would start having problems with it, so I got him the iPhone 11 and he's very happy with this new phone.",5,2020-01-25 11:03:00

"54","Great phone","I bought the phone for my daughter and she loves her iPhone 11 she had the 8 but she earned a new phone and best buy had a great deal and payment plan. As a mom I was glad to buy the phone from best buy.",5,2020-01-26 22:45:00
"55","Great new iPhone","I absolutely love my iPhone 11! I was using a 7plus which was fine but I really like the Face ID. I feel more secure and it’s much faster to wake up the phone. Plus “swiping” rather than using the home button is much better.",5,2020-01-15 18:10:00
"56","Like the face recognition","The face recognition makes it fast to open phone haven’t had the phone long so I’m still learning some of the features",5,2020-02-28 15:43:00
"57","Easy to learn to use","The phone does not have a home button like our previous phones.  However, getting used to the new system was very easy.  The lack of the home button makes the screen bigger and easier to read.  I have had some problems with the phone freezing and making it necessary to reboot the phone.",5,2019-10-07 09:28:00

"59","Great phone and easy online purchase","After attempting to purchase this phone at another online retailer on Black Friday and cyber Monday with numerous errors in the checkout process, I decided to purchase through Best Buy. While I lost some money in the cyber deal, the ease of checkout and store pickup was well worth it.",5,2019-12-13 15:37:00

"61","nice value","I Bought the iphone 11 for a family member that broke their phone. I set it up with ease, and compared to my much more expensive 11 pro, I can't really see much of a difference other than it being slightly larger. It works the same way.",5,2020-01-03 18:33:00
"62","The Apple I Phone 11 us a great phone","I am very happy with the purchase of the Apple I Phone 11.

was using.

It has many new features and has proven itself to be a great
purchase.",5,2020-01-17 16:31:00
"63","This is the play.","iPhone 11 is the phone to have this year. This phone has the most bang for your buck and competes with any camera phone on the market. Larger screen than the 11 pro and the exact picture quality minus the telephoto lenses. Which honestly, unless you’re a professional photographer, I don’t think is really needed. Wonderful phone for $300 cheaper. Buy this iPhone unless you have to have the pro for status!",5,2019-10-20 13:35:00
"64","I like the change","I went from a galaxy 7 edge to the iPhone 11. I was unsure about making the change because of the different systems. I do like how it works but it is also handy for me if i have a question i can just ask my wife as she has a 10.",5,2020-01-06 06:52:00

"66","New Phone Who Dis?","I finally upgraded to the new iPhone after using the 6+ for the last 4 1/2 years. It’s great but kind of hard getting used to not having a home button. I did also switch my carrier which is saving me an extra $50 a month which probably puts me over the top on this purchase.",5,2019-12-14 11:38:00
"67","This phone has it all.","I have absolutely ""no"" regrets about getting this iPhone11. It performs very well, and looks really beautiful at any angle. Great job, Apple!!!! I opted for the black, as black goes with everything.",5,2020-01-17 21:35:00

This is going  to be a great phone with IOS 13,  but now I just have to get used to IOS 13. I also want to give a shout out to Terrell and Adrienne for the great job they did at the Verizon desk. The great jobs they did will keep me coming back to the Best Buy store in Mishawaka Indiana.",5,2019-10-01 08:25:00

"73","I still prefer Samsung","I ordered two of these for Christmas for my boys. shipping was delayed by several days, but still got here in time. Pricing is better than verizon. Also, I'm not an apple fan because the durability is lacking compared to my Samsung. My Samsung is still in perfect shape and both apple iphone 8s were cracked on the back, charging port broken, and speakers broken. I'm hoping the iphone 11 will last longer than the precious models.",4,2019-12-27 18:49:00

"77","Phone has a lot of great features and easy to lear","Apple iPhone 11 was a good purchase especially upgrading from a lower level iPhone.  Cameras provide sharp, crisp pictures and operating system is fast.",5,2020-02-01 07:27:00
"78","iPhone 11","I just upgraded from my IPhone 6S.  While reading the reviews before deciding which phone to get the biggest issue I saw was that Apple removed the HOME button.

"84","working well","No problems, no issues. Actually got the device with 64GB memory and had to exchange within the 14d period for the other model.  Had to pay a fee for it but I knew that going in and it was reasonable.",5,2020-01-03 16:19:00

I had to upgrade and was SOLD on the camera part: Wow, do I need Help!  Nothing seems intuitive to me at all.  I wish there was an actual CLASS I could attend that would be a systematic way to learn how to operate this powerful tool.

"671","Great phone for a great price","I’m not really good at reviews but here goes. So I had an iPhone 7 until I bought this. I got used to not having a home button in twenty minutes after using this phone. The swiping is so easy and Face ID is amazing. Having two cameras stabilizes the angle of your outward facing photos taken. YouTube reviewers had shown the same images taken with both an XR and 11 and the position of the photo images made the focus more in the middle whereas the XR would change the angle a tiny bit to where certain objects being focused on were angled wrong. Sorry for saying the word angle so much, I’m just not good at describing this stuff. I would recommend you watch all of the YouTube videos comparing the newer iPhone models. This phone has night vision to enable Face ID in the dark. Whereas my 2018 iPad Pro cannot read my face in the dark. I don’t know what else to say, except that you should read every review and watch every review you can to decide on which iPhone is best for you. This phone is the cheapest iPhone that came out in 2019 but that doesn’t mean it’s bad. I love this phone very much. It has a really good battery life and standby time. Much better than my 7 which by the way I had the battery for that phone replaced and restored to 100% battery health a week before buying this and that battery sucks in comparison to this one even with the 100% restore. So yeah I’m happy with my phone. Also I use my phone mainly for music and I can listen with my AirPods all day and my phone will be at 40 something percent when the day is almost over. I know my grammar is bad. I just want people to know that this is a good phone",5,2020-01-24 18:04:00
"672","Ether than last years!","Good product at a great price. It was time for an upgrade!",4,2019-09-27 15:32:00

"675","finally got activated","getting phone bought from best buy activated by verizon was a total pain in the butt.  the Verizon Sim card shipped from best buy had to be replaced with a card from verizon and a hanging out on verizon support chat FOREVER.  

Hopefully the phone works and doesnt get smashed.",2,2019-12-05 22:06:00
"676","Nice Case","The case does provide extra protection if you drop your phone.  However, I didn't like the feel and decided to return it.",3,2019-12-13 17:26:00

"678","new iPhone!","I upgraded my iPhone 8 to an iPhone 11 and could not be happier.",3,2020-01-18 06:07:00
"679","Great phone with real all day battery","I upgraded to this phone from an iPhone 6s and it is a huge improvement. On the second battery in my 6s the phone would die after a few hours of moderate use. With the 11 after a full day(12+hours) of moderate to heavy use I have yet to put the battery lower than 35%. I much prefer Face ID over Touch ID and it is almost instantaneous. I compared the screen side by side to the Pro and besides the blacks being slightly blacker the resolution difference is not that apparent to me for everyday use. Cameras and photo processing are excellent. If you like the iPhone ecosystem then this is a great phone.",5,2019-10-18 17:14:00
"680","This phone is a great deal !","You get more bang for your buck with this iPhone than any other model.  It is easy to use and the battery holds a charge for a couple of days.  The new swiping that replaced the home button is actually easier, and I love the face recognition",5,2019-11-18 16:14:00
"681","Hate it","Bought this phone after loving my previous 2 iphones, 6s+ and 8s+. Absolutely HATE it. I bought it the day before leaving the country for 3 weeks and missed the return window. Face ID sucks. Screen is ""larger"" but it feels smaller since my hand is blocking part of it most of the time. Screen was very easily scratched compared to my last 2 iphones they definitely changed something there. Never even needed a protector and a few weeks with this it looks terrible. 

To boot I specifically asked the salesman if I would be able to use the phone overseas since I was flying out the next day and since I was paying for the phone in full he said yes no problem, but Verizon locks ALL devices for 60 days so there's nothing I could do. I was basically without a phone for 3 weeks unless on wifi and still missed the return window. Wish I never bought it.",1,2019-12-30 13:01:00
"682","Not a great product","Screen seems like it needs calibration. I was much happier with my old iPhone 7.",3,2019-12-19 13:33:00

I selected the wrong set up option the first time around but was able to easily and quickly reset the phone and set it up the way I wanted to.  The best part of setup?  It automatically downloaded all the apps from my old phone, saving me hours of time!  Love the new cameras!  Love the new colors!  Of course I selected my favorite:  purple!  The only issue I had with the phone resolved itself:  I could not hear calls unless I placed it in speaker mode, a minor-ish issue.  The sound on calls works perfectly now.",5,2020-01-17 22:12:00
"689","Mad","I should not even get charged a restocking fee. The phone would not activate when I got it. That’s the reason why I had to send it back. That’s mess up. I’m not happy. I’m done getting stuff on Best Buy.",1,2019-12-01 18:31:00
"690","Not pleased with product upgrade","This purchase was to replace IPhone 6 for being an 11 very little was an upgrade. Also more difficult to use for mature user. The sales person was not very helpful in teaching how to use this purchase",2,2019-09-27 17:42:00
"691","Love this phone!","Upgraded from the iPhone 6s Plus an what a difference.  The speed is fabulous and battery life is much longer (2 days easily).  Pictures are impressive.  Can finally do close-ups.  The colors a vivid and the screen size on the regular 11 is larger than the 6s Plus.  Purchased for my daughter also and she could not be happier with her 11.  I have not even begun to figure out all it can do.",5,2020-01-20 11:27:00
"692","Love this phone.","I had the iPhone 7 for over 4 years and the phone itself was in great shape but the battery life was awful. I’d have to charge it 3 or 4 times a day. I needed to upgrade. After doing research i decided on the iPhone 11 and i am very pleased. The purple color is beautiful. It’s a bigger phone but it’s not massive. The battery life is excellent so far. I charge it every other day. The camera is great. I’m very happy with this phone.",5,2019-12-15 08:33:00
"693","Camera takes the best pictures!","This phone is easy to learn how to use, even for a beginner!

If anyone is thinking of getting a new cell phone or just up grading this is the phone to get.",5,2020-01-24 15:38:00
"694","Excellent","This was an upgrade for my son from an iPhone SE. Great features, beautiful Red color, great battery life, and the camera is very good. iOS 13 works seamlessly so far on this device. Great option for anyone that’s wants to upgrade but doesn’t really need all of the perks the pro line offers.",5,2019-09-24 12:13:00
"695","Phone is good","Verizon rep told me that all of my pictures were on the cloud and would appear when I turned on the new phone. He was wrong and as a result I lost valuable memories that I cannot get back. I should never recommend Best Buy for a place to buy a phone.",1,2019-12-13 15:31:00
"696","Great upgrade from the 10(x,xr,xs)","I traded in my Iphone x for the 11. I believe this is worth the money than going to the Iphone 11 pro. 

I you dont need: 
telescope camera lens (3rd lens)
additional antenna
Stainless steel trim
Midnight Green color
1-2 hours more battery life
2 more meters under water
2688 x 1242 resolution instead of 2426 x 1125

"718","Love the color and the battery life","I've always eyed red version iPhones but I never really liked any of them and XR, while looking the color I wanted, was not the specs I wanted. But with this 11, I was finally able to let go of my iPhone X and move on. The display compared to iPhone X is different, and maybe it's inferior to some people, but to me it doesn't seem inferior as I can do everything I normally do on the phone okay. If you need color accurate phone to do photo or video editing, then it's not the phone you need, but then again, if you need to do it that badly you probably have a tablet or laptop for that.

Also, the battery life has been amazing. I sometimes forget to charge my phone overnight and with the 11, that is ok.

If you're looking to try iPhone or upgrade from an older iPhone and want a great value, this is it, especially with deals Best Buy has on this frequently.",5,2020-01-03 15:52:00

"725","Great Upgrade","Have been an iPhone user for years. This is the first time I’ve bought the latest and greatest phone after my iPhone 7 battery was dying. 

It has been a terrific upgrade.  Easy to get use to the Face ID as the home button replacement. 

My only complaint is that you have to use the volume and right side button simultaneously to turn the phone on& off. Not sure why Apple made this change from previous phones.",5,2019-12-06 11:07:00
"726","Great Phone!","Great phone!  It’s very easy to use and very stylish. The camera is an upgrade from previous models and takes very clear pictures.",5,2019-11-01 16:43:00

"728","Waited and waited and waited!","Before I finally made up my mind on the iPhone 11, I still had the iPhone 6s which I got when that was new. I watched all of the iPhones that came out after go by and finally decided to get the 11. Boy am I glad I did! I love everything about the phone. The camera is amazing, the new way to take a screenshot is much better and the the size is just perfect! It only took a few hours to get used to not having a home button. Oh, and the white is just gorgeous!",5,2020-02-14 22:21:00

"731","Good upgrade","So I went back to Apple, after being on Samsung for almost 4 years. I had a note 8 and was skeptical to upgrading to another Samsung, as I did miss things from Apple. After playing with the phones I was still indecisive. So I spoke to a rep and the best move was going back to Apple! I love Samsung’s note series but I just don’t use all those features. Now I did want the pro max but I just couldn’t see spending so much monthly on the phone. I’ve had this phone for two weeks and the battery is great, camera awesome and it’s fast. Like I said I did want the pro max so I do miss having a big screen.",5,2019-12-30 08:20:00
"732","I love my new phone","Love this phone and purple is my favorite color.so easy to understand and the pictures are great",5,2019-10-18 22:46:00
"733","Great phone.","So I upgraded from a 6s to the iPhone 11. It is taking some getting used to the new design of the phone. My biggest issue is getting used to the screen going edge to edge. I keep touching the screen with my other fingers and it interferes at times with what I am doing. It is a mi or inconvenience and will not be a problem once I get used to the design. The camera is great, much clearer pictures than I got before. So far, everything is running smooth with the operating system. Looking forward to this phone lasting me awhile.",5,2019-12-20 21:28:00
"734","Worth every penny!","I am a HUGE audiobook fan and have gone thru countless pairs of headphones including several of the “True Wireless” style.
I LOVES the ease of using only headphone with the TWS style and had already bought about 5 pair through the year because each pair would inevitably fall apart months after purchasing - but nonetheless I was committed to finding the perfect pair of TWs headphones! In fact so committed I had developed serious damage to my ears from wearing the ill-fitting contraptions!
After a recent doctor visit, I learned that I had double ear infections on account of those TWS headphones, so I had the green light from the hubs to spend whatever amount just so I’d stop talking about it AND because obviously “I needed them ;)”.

With that background in mind, the sound and fit of these are absolutely right on! Not once have my ears been the slightest bit tender and since wearing them I have regained all the hearing back in both ears I hadn’t realized I had lost until now.

Hey Siri also works how we wished it had for the last 10 years which is to say she basically just worked how she was supppsdd to.’this feature ended up being the one I was most surprised with because I didn’t really have much hope I’d ever use Siri like I do Alexa but I was wrong !",5,2019-11-23 04:55:00
"735","Another Quality Apple Product","Outstanding phone with all the usual iphone features and much improved camera as well as slightly better battery than the XR. 128 gb storage is the sweet spot and should be the starting point for ALL iphones. Screen resolution is better than you'd expect. iOS 13 is a little buggy right now but will get better with updates. If you don't mind paying the Apple tax this is a great product that should meet all your cell phone needs.
(sidenote: shopping on Best Buy website is a mess. Decision to replace weekly ad with top deals is a HUGE head scratcher. I find myself spending less time shopping on the site than i did previously. Come on Best Buy..FIX THIS)",5,2019-10-20 06:04:00
"736","Nice phone","The IPhone 11 is a pretty nice phone. I love everything about it except the size. I am used to a smaller size so this is the major thing I have to adjust to. After making a few adjustments now my battery life is wonderful you must shut off the automatic mail push option to manual hey Siri option and background refresh to extend battery life. I love the wide camera option and the dark mode feature. You won’t be disappointed with this phone.",4,2019-09-28 07:19:00
"737","Great Pics and Battery Life","I’ve just upgraded from an iPhone 5s so needless to say, this was a huge jump in functionality and features.  Was easy to learn all the new and exiting features, easy to set up and the Best Buy rep. That helped us was fantastic.  Good experience all the way around.  Love the fact I can now get 2.5 to 3 days out of the phone before having to recharge and I’m constantly on it for work and play.  My pics are so much better now, even before any editing. The zoom feature on the 11 works great without the usual graininess.",5,2019-11-22 18:05:00
"738","I upgraded to the I phone 11 - great camera.","Great camera.  learning curve is not difficult after using an I phone 6 for 4 yrs.  Camera has 2 lens and self adjusts to dark surroundings.  I took a picture of my veranda in the dark and it lit up the furniture as though it was daylight.
I certainly have much to learn - but I dislike the options of clicking on a person's photo or name to send a message.  Typing in their name and having name recognition is so much faster.",5,2019-12-20 20:21:00

"740","Great phone","I upgraded from an iPhone 7.  It took a bit to adjust to the changes. (No home button and all the swipes) but I am enjoying it now.

Other than that, it is great.",5,2020-01-16 01:51:00
"741","Great phone","It took some getting used to the changes that were made to the iphones - I hardly miss the button now.  The first day I was lost without the button but within a day I got the hang of it.  Battery life is great - hope it doesn’t go down when a new model comes out.",5,2020-02-07 19:43:00
"742","Great phone","I am impressed how long the phone is holding a charge. I don’t have to charge my phone every night anymore. This is great. Haven’t had a chance to use the camera yet but I’m sure they will be great. 

The phone is easy to use. I was afraid that since it didn’t have a home button that it would take a learning curve to learn to operate. That wasn’t the case. I like my new phone.",5,2019-12-20 19:14:00
"743","Great phone!","I had some issues, probably from the IOS 13 bugs restoring this phone from a backup. It froze up, shut down and would not power on. After a visit to BB a tech got it back up running using vol up, vol down and power button combo unfroze the phone. After a couple of IOS 13 updates it works fine. Battery life is incredible! All day of sometime heavy use without a mid day boost. Love the wireless charging, but Apple should throw in a wireless charger rather than making us buy one separately. I huge update from my old iPhone 7.

Low light pics and wide angle photos are fantastic!",5,2019-10-11 20:40:00
"744","from a 6 to an 11 and I can still keep up!","I'm old! I have an iphone! I love the new camera; portrait mode is my favorite! The motions for use are still intuitive. I'm sure my new iphone does 1000s of things I have't discovered yet. Super fun to use!

"746","Amazing phone!","Absolutely in love with this phone!! I traded in my iPhone X (which I was hesitant about doing since it was so similar) & I am so glad I did. The purple is such a beautiful color & I love the size of the 11. Battery life is excellent. I don’t notice not having the OLED screen like I thought I would. The price for the phone is on point as well. Camera is exceptional considering the price.",5,2019-12-03 10:45:00
"747","Great New IPhone!","Nice new iPhone. Now u get to Personalize your phone with different colors and accessories. The camera is very nice makes you wanna always take selfie’s and other photos.

"748","Enjoy the upgrade from my i6.","I am still in transition status. Some functions the same, some new. The transfer of data to the new phone went well with one hick-up. The apps went into a constant waiting status. As it turned out, a simple turn off, turn on of the phone, allowed the apps to complete. Picture quality is great.",5,2019-12-20 18:22:00
"749","Love the new IPhone","New phone is great, this 11 takes great pics, has some new features that took a bit to get used to since I was graduating from the 6s plus.
I like that it is a bit smaller, fits in small back pockets easier.
I think this is the perfect upgrade for those that want a good phone that takes good pictures and video at a reasonable price.
If you’re looking for a higher quality camera, I would recommend one of the other 11’s",5,2019-10-26 09:43:00
"750","Good phone","Nothing is ever a perfect five star. That being said, I actually went from and iPhone 6S plus to the iPhone 11. My iPhone 6s Plus battery and the phone were just starting to slow down so I decided to buy a newer phone. Just like all cell phones they all run great and fast as expected when you first buy them. I do like the wireless charging feature because constantly plugging in and unplugging the phone from the charging port will eventually damage it just like it did on my iPhone 6S plus. The camera is definitely a lot better.",4,2019-12-06 17:18:00

Overall it is a great phone and I would recommend it to anyone.",5,2019-11-17 20:01:00
"753","Fantastic Phone","Upgraded from my iPhone 7 Plus and couldn't be happier. The camera is incredible, the processor is very quick, and the battery lasts all day. I don't really see a reason why you'd want to pay hundreds more for the Pro or Pro Max.",5,2019-12-31 09:24:00

"810","Very happy - switched from Android","I've been very happy with my new iPhone 11.  Was a long time Android user but just switched to be compatible with my kids.  Pleasantly surprised that I like it as much as I do.

Also, no one in sales/support (Verizon, Apple, Best Buy) seemed to know the answers on how seamless the process would be to continue using Google Products (Gmail/Contacts/Calendar) from the Android ecosystem on the iPhone.  Many told me that I could import my data into Apple apps but not maintain both databases concurrently.  I am happy to say that this is WRONG.
  
In the Apple Calendar and Apple Contacts, within app settings, you can set your default calendar/contacts account  to be your Google based accounts.  I also loaded the Google Calendar app so the interface is familiar, but I have it sync to the Apple Calendar app so that I can see calendar events in Apple Car Play and use Siri to make new appointments on the fly.   

Gmail app is fine on Android.  I do not use the Apple Mail app. 

So, I have the best of both Apple and Google worlds!!

Couldn’t see the point, since I usually use my phone to text, talk and google. Probably the most outstanding benefit so far has been battery life. I get 3-4 days of usage per charge. Obviously, I’m not on my phone a lot,but I wasn’t getting anywhere close to that with my LG V20 with a new battery. The switch over to apple os was pretty minor.

Takes great pictures.  If your concerned if it will be a big change in how it functions just go online and people explain all the things this phone can do or ask your sales person at Best Buy.  Sean was our salesperson and he was very good at explaining what iPhone 11 does and Transferring our information from other phone. Process buying and transferring information was quick.

"890","Making the change from android...","I've used iOS before, but am coming back to Apple from 4 years of Android. Reason--one word: facetime. It just works so well (at least in my experience). A number of other features are similar considerations. Android is very interesting and can be tweaked, but Apple just works. 

The battery life on the 11 is incredible. With moderate use, you can go at least 2 days between charges. My aging Samsung wasn't even making it a full day. I wonder if that's because of the quick-charge feature.

So far, so good.",5,2019-12-16 11:58:00

The phone is very user friendly. Major difference is there is no home button so you get use to lifting the phone to come on and swilling to get to other apps.",5,2020-02-19 17:49:00
"896","Love it","I’m enjoying my new phone however the hype about having the two Cameras is not all that, in my opinion. I will say the photo quality and clarity is outstanding. Perhaps if I
Got the pro with three cameras I could find more a bigger difference. But overall satisfied with my purchase.",5,2020-01-25 11:43:00
"897","Best apple ever!","Can’t believe I waited so long to upgrade.  The  iPhone 11 is absolutely  awesome.   This is my 3rd iPhone and I’ve never been disappointed.  The battery life itself is reason enough to upgrade to the 11, but the camera will blow you away.  If you are thinking of upgrading do yourself a favor and get the iPhone 11.",5,2020-01-10 19:17:00
"898","Great phone and great camera!","I normally take horrible pictures, but no more! The wide lens is amazing! The night mode automatically adjusts the lighting to create a great photo. One of my favorite features is the portrait mode which blues out the background when it is focused on a particular person or object. I am glad the phone is water resistant rated because I am not afraid to accidentally drop it in water! Overall great iPhone!",5,2019-12-08 10:45:00
"899","Love it!","I love my new iPhone 11! The button broke on my 8 plus and now I don’t have to worry about that with this phone. I like that it’s a smaller phone with the same size screen! I also didn’t realize how slow my old phone was until I upgraded!",5,2020-01-27 16:52:00
"900","Easy to manipulate and move between functions!","I love the size of the 11. I have avoided the larger products because I like to be able to text 1-handed if needed and the smaller screen was adequate for my purposes. The face recognition is quick and the lack of the home button is not the adjustment I expected.",5,2020-01-16 16:33:00
"901","Has great screen quality, the camera is the bom","This is my first time with an apple phone and I Love it. The service and overall quality is the bomb.

"904","Good phone","I was excited to finally get a new phone after having a iPhone 6 for several years. The camera is amazing and the features with the camera are great. There has been issues with echo during calls. Other than that the size is good and the base memory is more than enough for me.",4,2020-02-25 19:32:00
"905","Great Phone, but I kinda wish it were smaller","I appreciate the bells and whistles of new iOS and improved battery life as I moved on from iPhone 6, but the new size and weight takes some getting used to. My new holsters make it even more difficult to access my front pants pockets and add even more weight to the phone. That said, everything else about the phone is great--larger capacity--64gb from 16gb = much more music capacity; and it probably is better for my old eyes. I thought I'd miss the Touch ID button, but Face ID actually does work quicker…If I weren't so cheap, I'd probably had gone for the 11 pro!",4,2019-12-13 17:16:00
"906","Love","I bought this for my daughter's Christmas gift She loves it . The camera is amazing.

"1174","most expensive paper weight I have ever bought!","After over 15 years with apple this device has forever put a bad taste in my mouth about ever doing business with them ever again!
I bought my phone on release day and just 16 days later it started randomly showing a blank screen with only a apple log and it would do this for hours the first time it did this I was actually downtown New Orleans with my small children and it made it to where we literally ended up completely lost and in the ghetto we couldn't call for help even if we wanted to which put me and my kids lives in danger which isn't acceptable! I also work solely from my phone and because of this I have lost contracts as well as not been able to go to work when bringing this up to an apple supervisor I was told me saying  that this phone has caused huge issues including putting my kids and I in a dangerous situations and putting my lively hood in danger was offensive to her and that maybe I should travel with a map and find a different job and then she Hung up on me!!",1,2019-10-06 20:37:00

The next day I received an email that my order would be cancelled if not fulfilled by Jan 3. Two days later I received an email that my order was cancelled. I lost out",1,2019-12-27 17:48:00
"1177","Buyer Beware","Multiple hardware and software issues; one of the major issues is echoing and feedback that callers hear on their end when I use speakerphone, facetime or bluetooth.  

Apple replaced it once and the replacement has the same issues.  Several trips to genius bar and multiple phone conversations with tech support just to find out that the replacement needs to replaced.  So this phone is great for pictures, just not for making phone calls!

I've saved money for a year to upgrade to iphone 11 and now I am back to using my 6s. 

Others are having the same issue and more information can be found on apple forums at the link below, however apple doesn't seem to want to address the problem.
