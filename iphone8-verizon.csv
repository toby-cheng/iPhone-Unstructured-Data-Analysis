"1","Love This Phone!","Perfect phone. I didn’t need the newest model to be happy. I had one like this and lost it, so it was a good buy and very happy I have it again!",5,2019-11-22 17:59:00
"2","Great Iphone for Everyone","My Iphone 6 took a bath and I felt the best place to buy a new phone would be Best Buy.  I felt very comfortable shopping here because I knew I would get all the help I needed.  Love Best Buy!
Love my new Iphone 8...",5,2019-11-18 06:37:00
"3","Great phone for the price","Great phone for the price very easy to use and it does everything I wanted to with lots of storage",5,2019-01-17 17:23:00
"4","Great phone","This phone will do everything my laptop can do and more.",5,2018-07-20 14:23:00
"5","Very style and easy to use!","I love my new phone. Love the slim style and ease of use. With 256 GB, I have plenty of space for all of my needs! Takes great photos too. I got a great deal on this purchase.",5,2018-12-22 01:24:00
"6","Great Camera","As the iPhones have evolved, so have the cameras. The optical zoom feature, up to 10x, is great. I took a sunset photo of the Pacific with a resulting photo that rivals my digital camera (which is why I rarely use that camera).",5,2018-02-22 07:52:00
"7","Great phone, good size (not TOO big); no probs.","Upgrading from an old iPhone 5s, only thing I really had to adjust to was the new home button and the sleep/wake button being on the side rather than on the top.  At first, because of sleep button being on the side and the way I hold the phone, I found that I would also depress one of the volume buttons at the same time as e sleep button, so it wouldn't work - quickly realized what I was doing and that there was nothing wrong with the phone, and am more careful now.  Significantly faster, clearer and much better sound than the old phone.  Shoulda got it sooner!  Also got it cheaper at Best Buy than from Apple.",5,2019-08-23 16:37:00
"8","Love the “home” button and size.","The staff helped me transition from an Android system to Apple. While the product is an important part, the personal service from everyone is what sends me to Best Buy. They knew the products, were courteous and gave explanations without pushing me towards an item. Once I had decided on the I Phone 8, features were pointed out and how to use them. I find the phone to be what I need and love that I have a “home” button.",5,2019-05-19 08:04:00
"9","iPhone 8 vs iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone SE, & iPhone X.","I have recent experience using both the iPhone SE and iPhone 6s Plus. The Plus model was too big since I use a case with a belt clip to carry the phone, and the SE's screen was a bit too small. I am going to compare my review of the iPhone 8 (purchased unlocked at full price and used with Verizon prepaid) mostly to the iPhone 6s Plus, but one has to understand that the SE especially at prepaid price is an excellent, outstanding phone too with almost all of the same features as the Plus!) 

Pros:

The iPhone 8 is an upgrade in a few ways. Apple includes a compare feature on its website so I won't go into all of the details, but I will try to address the ones that are upgrades to the iPhone 6s Plus. 

True Tone display does make the screen easier to read because the lighting isn't as harsh. This is coming from someone who has vision problems and prefers the ""daylight"" bulbs because I need good lighting to see.

This phone features water resistance, which means one can now uses cases that might provide better protection or do not muffle sound. With that said, I use a Ghostek Nautical 2 case also sold through BestBuy. It provides great protection combined with waterproofing. Since I use hearing aids to stream audio, sound being muffled isn't an issue and people can hear me clearly.

The camera specs *seem* to be similar, but I can see a difference! The pictures are clearer, sharper, and more detailed. Also, this smaller model has the optical image stabilization for the video too. To get the best quality video, I shoot in 4K even though the final output will be in 1080p. Larger files won't take up as much room on this model thanks to upgraded compression features. This model includes an improved flash too.

The sound quality on the iPhone 8 seems to be louder and clearer. There is a front speaker too.

With my previous phones I also used battery cases. The iPhone 8 with the same use seems to get me through the whole day, but I plan to buy an external battery charger that will also allow me to charge wirelessly soon.

Neutral:

The bluetooth is supposed to be an upgrade. I am not sure if this is a hardware of software issue with iOS 11 through 11.2.1. At the time of this writing, I am having some issues with it. With phone calls, my made for iPhone hearing aids do not work as well. Sometimes only one connects. Other times I notice a periodic static or crackling sound.

Areas for Improvement:

What I do not like about the IPhone 8 is the glass back because of how it is designed. In my opinion, it is a very poor design choice, and what weighted the most heavily on my decision to knock star off the overall rating. It is almost half of the cost of the phone without insurance to replace this! The iPhone 4s has a glass back too. However, one could remove two screws and slide off the back, which means the back plate and battery were easily replaced.

A fast charging wall adapter was not included in this premium priced phone. I use a Belkin (also sold through BestBuy) or iPad one instead of the one included with great results.

Without a case, the ""gold"" looks like rose gold around the edges and several shades lighter on the back. It looks expensive and stylish, but this look disappears with a case. I miss my Rose Gold that could be seen even through a clear back case.

Comments:

I didn't wait for the iPhone X. I think the technology behind the facial recognition features is impressive. However, without Touch ID too, I am willing to wait to see how this works out and will decide again when I upgrade next time. I would prefer the bigger iPhone screen on a smaller size. The built-in portrait features are a plus, but I can do most of that with software. These three differences were not worth the price difference to me.

Overall Conclusion:

I am enjoying using my IPhone 8 with improves on previous models, and it was the best overall choice for me.",4,2017-12-24 08:59:00
"10","Works as expected.","This is a replacement for another iPhone that lost a battle with a stair step.  My daughter goes to school in another state so we went to BB on a Saturday, she received it in the mail on Tuesday, activation and set up for her was a snap, and she was up and running in no time.  It works as expected with no further issues.",5,2019-11-15 16:30:00
"11","A great Apple phone that fits in your back pocket!","I was so sad when my SE’s  recently stopped working, and I had to send it to the recycle pile.
I didn’t want a phone that was bigger than my palm & found the iPhone 8 had almost everything on my list. 
The only thing that I don’t like about this phone, although I know I’ll get used to it is, the on button is no longer on the top right corner of the phone, but on it’s right side.
It’s also slightly larger, but still fits in my hand & back pocket, which was a must for me. 
Like I mentioned before, I’ll get used to it in time. Overall, I’m very satisfied with my purchase.",4,2019-10-29 05:59:00
"12","Great Replacement for Iphone 5S","Similar in size to the previous model but twice the memory and a faster chip speed. Wireless charging ready. Easy to transfer data from old IPhone to new iPhone. My wife loves it!",5,2019-12-26 10:37:00
"13","Home Button","Good value if you want to have a phone with the home button and get into the Apple ecosystem at a reasonable price.  The phone will last 3-4 years before they cut iOS support.",5,2020-01-27 12:24:00
"14","Huge improvement over my last phone","I don’t upgrade to the latest and greatest. Moving up from a 5s to this is an amazing upgrade. Love the size and the storage capacity. No more deleting photos or songs to create more room",5,2019-12-31 15:04:00
"15","Good device for the price","I bought this as an upgrade from an iPhone 6. There’s no doubt that this is a better phone, in all aspects. It’s fast, wireless charging is a cool feature, and it’s nice to have 64 GB of storage. I do have some regret that I didn’t get the iPhone X, but it really came down to price. The iPhone 8 was on sale, at the time of purchase, and was half the cost of the X.

Pros:
- 64 GB storage is ample (at least for now). Definitely a breath of fresh air after dealing with 16 GB and constant storage management. 
- The phone is fast. The A11 chip seems really responsive. Apps open quickly, on-screen animations/transitions are seamless, and it just feels fluid in your hands. 
- It has a good camera. 12 MP is really all I need for the photos I take. It’s definitely not the best phone camera around, but is a noticeable upgrade from the iPhone 6. 
- Wireless charging. The reason I had to upgrade is because the charging port on my last phone broke. It’s nice that I don’t have to worry about wearing out this phone’s port. Wireless charging is convenient and seems to power up the phone just as quick as plugging it in. 

Cons:
- This phone feels outdated (because it is). I really don’t care too much about having the latest features and an all-screen front. But, if it wasn’t for the upgraded home button and the revised Space Gray color, I wouldn’t know if I was holding an iPhone 8 or 6. 
- The lack of a headphone jack is disappointing. Yes, I can get an adapter or Bluetooth and I will probably get used to it, in time. But, it’s kind of a pain, at the moment. 

Overall, I like this phone. It definitely lacks the modern features and ‘feel’ that other current phones have, but it is a good performer. If you are a fan of Apple phones, need to upgrade, and are looking to save some cash, I would recommend it.",4,2019-06-22 06:29:00
"16","Exactly as expected...","When you select an Apple product you have a good idea what you are getting - Best Buy gave a great price & it's exactly what my teenage daughter wanted.",5,2020-01-10 15:53:00
"17","Good phone for my teen at a fair price","this phone was on sale due to being an older model and it is a good phone for my teen - has everything available without costing an arm and a leg.",5,2020-01-12 13:28:00
"18","Great overall phone.","The phone is not the latest or greatest, however, it's a great phone for its price.",5,2020-01-31 15:17:00
"19","Great help at Best Buy","The Best Buy helped my granddaughter select the right phone phone for her. No high pressure just help. She is very happy with phone. No problems.",5,2020-01-03 18:55:00
"20","Ok","I like the size that I can easily use with one hand and store in my pocket. Lots of space for music and photos. Faster options available but I’m generally happy with it.",4,2020-01-31 10:36:00
"21","Works as expected","No issues. Works as expected. I like the convenience of picking up at Best Buy.",5,2020-01-31 09:15:00
"22","Great upgrade","So far, so good.  Much better than the iPhone 6s which wouldn't hold a charge, even after the battery was replaced by Apple.",5,2020-01-12 10:44:00
"23","Love this phone!","I recently upgraded to the iPhone 8 from a 5s. It's great. I love that Apple products are pretty seamless in terms of transitions. I had no problem starting up my new phone from a previous backup of my old phone. All contacts, apps, photos, etc. appeared on my new phone with no issue. It was an adjustment from the 5s because I had it for 3 or 4 years, but I keep my phones a long time. I definitely recommend a screen shield and nice case. Small investments that keep your phone like new for a long time. There are some cool new features with this phone that I haven't quite mastered like 3D touch and Portrait mode. 3D touch worked in the store with the sales person coaching me, but I didn't master it before I left so now I can't get it (again more so user error than anything). Also portrait mode isn't showing up in the camera options and I have updated the phone since I bought it. Other than that, I love the phone and love the service I received at Best Buy during purchase.",5,2017-12-15 11:17:00
"24","Its better than my Flip Phone!","SO I went shopping with a elderly lady who was trading in her flip phone for a new smart phone since her family thought this would be a great way for them to keep in touch. We stopped at Target first since they had a $200 gift card available when you purchased an IPHONE 8. Come to find out, Target hasn't had this phone in stock since November and the sale was void. We decided to stop at Best Buy after this, and We worked with some of the nicest people ever. They recommended the IPHONE since my elderly lady already had an IPAD and this would be the easiest conversion to a smart phone since the apps and menu are the same. I really wish APPLE had EASY MODE but we did get the ICONS and APPS bigger and everyone is happy. Thanks!",5,2019-03-16 19:49:00
"25","Excellent!","The battery in my 6s was replaced once and the new battery never stayed charged so I  wanted a phone that was the same size with new features!   The 8 was the answer!   Very pleased!",5,2019-12-06 16:24:00
"26","Love my iPhone 8","So let me start by saying I have owned this phone for a year now and it's just as great as the day I first brought it home. I went for the 256GB version because I was tired of running out of space on my old iPhone 6. No memory issues now. There is a ton of space on this phone.
Lastly, I will say my family has purchased the iPhone X and they wish they would have went with the 8. I cannot explain the reasons behind their dislike of the X other than missing the button at the bottom. Anyway, they have convinced me to stick with my iPhone 8 for as long as I can and I honestly expect to have it for several more years.",5,2018-11-28 21:23:00
"27","Excellent incremental update","I won't go into specifics about the upgrade in this iteration of iPhone (you can find all of that on Apple's homepage), however I will say the incremental upgrades are noticeable and welcomed. I use the wireless charging everyday, the screen looks much ""richer"", and everything seems to be very snappy. However, I wouldn't say this was a significant upgrade from the 7 and wouldn't really be worth it (in my opinion) to go from a 7 to an 8.",5,2017-10-29 19:44:00
"28","Terrific phone!","If you can still buy them, this one is probably a great way to get an iPhone without sacrificing limbs to pay for the bloomin thing! Excellent product, as usual with Apple.",5,2019-12-02 21:39:00
"29","great phone","easy to set up and use. replaced an iPhone 4. salesperson at best buy was great. she was very professional. Verizon was a pain as usual",5,2019-12-20 22:55:00
"30","Perfect phone","Is everything I imagined, no issues at all, I love it",5,2020-01-31 18:34:00
"31","Love it","I haven’t had an iPhone since my 4s I decided to switch to Samsung now back to iPhone I love it battery life is fantastic I use it listening to music about 6 hrs at work and after an 8 hr shift I have 85% battery life still I charge the phone every other day it’s kool not having to worry if the phone will run out of battery",5,2017-11-15 21:17:00
"32","phones & Apple watch","Salesperson was amazing!  She was so patient and answered all questions. Very pleased with our Best Buy experience.",5,2019-12-27 18:27:00

"34","Our first iphones,","Is is taking some time to get used to the new phones,  But with that said if you are looking at new phones you should go to best buy,  They are so much more knowledgeable than the staff at Verizon.",5,2019-11-08 18:12:00
"35","Great phone.","Very happy with the phone and the quality of service that I received at Best Buy.",5,2020-01-15 16:44:00
"36","Cool phone!!","Wasn't sure if I should switch the iOS operating system from Android or not but so far this phone has been super easy to use and feels great in the hand!!",5,2019-12-01 03:16:00
"37","Love it!","Compared this one to the 11, but for what I use the phone for, this one is perfect",5,2020-01-13 06:44:00
"38","Very easy iphone to use.","It was very easy to transisition from an iPhone 6 to iPhone 8. I very much like the finger print recognition.",5,2019-12-27 16:30:00
"39","Always an iPhone fan","This phone is bigger than my old iPhone, and I wish they still made the smaller size that fits in my pocket better. But it works well, and I got an adapter to use my headphone. Wish they still had the headphone jack, though.",5,2019-10-18 15:49:00
"40","Gift for pre teen girl working out well, perfect s","Excellent service at store.  Thank you. The phone size is perfect for her, I like it better then the larger IPhone Plus size. Yet has all the options she needs.",5,2019-11-22 15:13:00
"41","Why buy more than you need?","Daughter requested a phone for Christmas to replace her iPhone 6 with only 16 GB. Wasn’t keen on shelling out $1000 or more for an X or whatever, and 8s were being sold new in the box. Has most of the newest features, aside from facial recognition. She’s thrilled with her new phone and I look heroic. Win-win!

One cool thing about the 8 that has me wanting one is the Qi wireless charging capability. We tried it with my daughter’s new 8 and it works as advertised!",5,2018-12-28 13:00:00
"42","Great phone and price lowered","I like that it is a smaller phone then the newer ones. I have to charge it every other day. I wish it held a charge a little longer.",5,2019-12-08 11:21:00
"43","Love it","I like this phone so much, when it was time to upgrade, I got the same model.",5,2020-01-11 09:21:00
"44","Good upgrade","The battery on my I phone 5s was dying so I needed to replace my phone. I did not need anything quite as elaborate as an I phone 10 so I opted for the 8. It really liked the small size of my I phone 5 but needed to upgrade and found the larger size is fine. I appreciate the 256 GB that is available.",5,2017-10-13 18:51:00
"45","I love thIPhone 8.","Easy switch from my previous iPhone which was at least six years old. The service and expertise of the sales staff was exceptional. That is why we always shop at Best Buy",5,2019-11-08 17:02:00
"46","iPhone 8","Good price.  Frustrating experience trying to get it activated, but they compensated us and it all worked out.  Son is happy with phone.",5,2019-11-28 17:09:00
"47","Great iPhone good value","Upgraded from iphone 6, lower cost than new iPhones, work well and great value.",5,2020-01-04 09:47:00
"48","Takes getting used to","Now that I've had my phone for 3 weeks, I'm beginning to like it a lot more. My last 2 iPhones were the 5S and SE, which were smaller and sturdier. I chose the 8 because of the price and because it fits into my bicycle phone case mount. With that being said, I'm not sure I want to take my phone on bike rides (not a good idea--what if something happens), since it's made of glass. The home button works differently than the other two phones, but thankfully I got Siri every time I punched the home button too hard, and she could help me out. Once you've paid for the protective coating for the screen and found a reasonable case that seems sturdy enough to protect the rest of this slimline phone, hope that's all you have to pay for. Also, I drive an older car with a bluetooth not recognized by the iPhone, so I had to buy a different auxiliary adapter, since the lightening port is different. This just means I can't recharge my phone and listen to music at the same time.",4,2019-02-13 11:45:00
"49","Just what I had been looking to buy.","Staff at Best Buy (Alex, Brian and Shelby) were very helpful in assisting my selection and purchase.  5 stars!",5,2019-12-13 16:05:00
"50","My husband is an iPhone fan","Have been using iPhone for several years. Loves this phone, still has glass screen. Awesome performance",5,2019-12-14 13:25:00
"51","Great phone for my hard-working husband.","Purchased the iphone 8 for a gift for my husband.  The Best Buy store personnel helped get it activated and ready for my husband.  Even though he does not handle new technology very well, this was an easy transition for him.  He is using his new phone frequently with no problems!",5,2019-08-15 11:01:00
"52","Excellent product and support by Best Buy","We bought a new phones and changed carriers thru Best Buy.  BB did an excellent job of migrating to the new carrier and also migrating from our older iPhone versions.   Very smooth transition.",5,2019-07-18 17:50:00
"53","Gold color is nice","This is the lowest price to get you into the iPhone ecosystem. Purchased from Best Buy for $90 off on sale for an 83 year old to replace 5c. Perfect for her and does the trick for what she needs. Very much wish they still made the SE or equivalent. Phone is still fluid and quick with the A11 processor. Glad that Apple started including 64GB standard. The gold glass back is very attractive.",4,2019-09-07 10:03:00
"54","8 is great","Apple is up to 11 now, but I see no need yet to move away from 8. With all the updates it still has everything I need and the wireless charging and connectivity all work well.",5,2019-10-18 14:16:00
"55","iPhone 8","Finally mom got rid of the flip phone. Went with the 8 because it still has home button like her iPad.",5,2019-12-07 06:58:00
"56","NIce upgrade but pricey","This is a very capable smart phone that most people can use without much tech savvy. Moving apps, contacts, and files from the old Iphone to the new one was easy. Getting our cell phone carrier to realize that we were using a new phone that we bought at Best Buy (not a dedicated cell phone store) was a struggle. 

This phone is a cost effective alternative to an Iphone X, which was more than twice the price.",4,2019-08-23 18:44:00

"60","Duplicate phone replacement.  Oldie but a goodie.","This is one of my daughter's phone.  She knew exactly what she wanted and we saved money. Our sales associate was excellent and I was impressed by the attention we received from the entire team.",5,2019-09-27 16:51:00
"61","Helpful?","I have to wonder what may be the point of writing a review on a phone. The tribal mentality that is Android vs. iPhone has obfuscated any real discussion around fitting the right tool to function. 

Subjectively, and objectively as one can muster, it is redundant to say this is a beautiful functional top shelf device. The only thing I can offer to anyone on the fence is consider whether you are someone that ""needs"" your device... needs your phone to meld into the million parts of the daily kaleidoscope of your life, to find it's place in your own personal flurry.... or if you are someone that is buying the phone primarily as a daily fidget spinner of sorts; a electronic time killer to insulate the space between the minutes. To keep the walls warm between seasons.

Neither of those are ill things, nor does one always find themselves only in summer flurries or wedded to the cruel mistress of hurry up and wait. 

Do you need your device, or does your device need you?

The iPhone 8 is a stalwart servant to your court.

Android is a small child, a forever needy fledgling.

The rest is what you're made of.",5,2017-12-24 03:35:00

Fortunately, I met Jenn at the Apple area of Best Buy and she showed me the iPhone 8. I felt it was an overkill for my needs but I took a chance with it because of the great sale they had. Very glad that I did and EXTREMELY happy with my purchase. It's only been a couple of weeks but every day I am discovering something new with it's performance and functionality. I can't believe the difference of it's performance over the iPhone 5s. There have been a few glitches with updates but that is software and not the hardware. I've been an Apple user with laptops and phones for 8 years and yes, I'm biased. I'm confident in Apple taking care of the minor software update issues.",5,2018-03-03 10:13:00

Right now there aren't many great deals on Apple phones, especially the X/XR/XS models. Price per month on the Verizon payment plan for this phone was a reasonable $25, so we went with it.

However, one upgrade that I thought was on it was the portrait mode and it does not have that feature... that is only available in the plus model so be aware of that. Otherwise I am happy with my I phone 8. 
 Easy purchase and good price for this iphone compared to other prices I looked into for a brand new iPhone 8. I purchased it in the gold color which I like.",4,2018-07-06 14:14:00

"117","Great phone with great features","Wish the phone was more different from an exterior POV than the 6S I upgraded from, but overall it's a great phone. Camera is out of this world good for a smartphone. It's a little different getting used to the lack of a physical home button, but the interface is still good. Battery life is at least double what I was getting on my old 6S and that was after having installed a new battery several months ago. Overall, I'm happy with this phone!",5,2018-08-10 13:51:00

After deciding against the 8S (too big) and the X (I need my home button and not a fan of the Facial Recognition) I chose the iPhone 8 with 256 GB capacity. So far so good, thing is super fast and I have plenty of storage now. I got to keep my old phone as a backup JIC instead of trading it in to Verizon for peanuts!",5,2018-04-13 12:33:00
"146","expensive but works well","We bought this iPhone 8 to replace my wife's 3 year old iPhone 6s. The two phones seem very similar, but the new one has a lot more memory (256 GB vs. 16 GB).

"148","So far so good","I enjoy the intuitive interface of iPhones. Only upgraded because iOS 11 wrecked my iPhone 6. Will go to 12 on the 8 but no further.

"167","Nice Upgrade!","My mother got this for herself she wasn’t to fond of the bigger screen so she got the smaller version of the 8. She has been use to the home button being a physical button so this one has the home button from the iPhone 7 which has that Taptic feedback home button. Which isn’t an actual button. Just felt really weird for her but eventually got how it works. Now it’s not an issue other than that she says it’s a nice upgrade for the iPhone if you need to upgrade and want a smaller screen.",5,2017-10-28 13:17:00

I recommend the product protection though, my daughter shut previous phone in car door. Not even the Otterbox Defender Case could protect it from two slams of a car door. After a $500+ payoff of destroyed phone, she is now paying for a new phone.

"188","Good upgrade from an iPhone SE","I purchased this phone to replace my son's iPhone SE when we switched from Sprint to Verizon. This phone has already taken a couple of tumbles and is holding up fine, though it is in an Otterbox. The iPhone 8 is a huge upgrade from an SE but it still doesn't have many new features that really differentiate it from an iPhone 6 if you're only using it for calling, texting, emailing, gaming, and surfing the web. Not a lot of innovation coming out from Apple lately.",4,2018-09-06 21:23:00

I’m sure there’s way more to come.",4,2018-11-10 13:57:00
"243","Great phone, huge upgrade","So I recently purchased the iPhone 8 to upgrade from my original iPhone 6 and I am never going to look back.

It is a nice step up from her old iPhone 5c which she was very reluctant to give up. The hearing aid apps and some of the other accessibility features are a huge plus for the iPhones in general and the 8 gives her a boost.",4,2018-10-26 12:24:00
"256","It's an iPhone","I just upgraded to this iPhone 8 from my iPhone 6 (which was literally splitting at the seams). So far it's..... well and iPhone. I don't know about all the plusses yet, but the negatives are: costly (of course), the ridiculous haptic response of the home button (feels like the phone is breaking - why can't we turn off the response), and the obvious lack of a headphone jack (which I knew ahead of time). I guess the level of customization has improved, but I'm not sure about the faster speed or better camera (I use this mostly for calls, texts, and simple game apps (not as a mini computer). If I wasn't locked into Apple products, or if the older model iPhones were still so expensive, I would have stayed with the 6.",3,2018-07-20 12:44:00

I like the Plus- my last phone was standard size and I really love the larger screen. But it’s heavy. 
Sometimes the phone stops responding to touch screen for no apparent reason. This is concerning. And I may bring it up with Apple Support after a little google research. 
Overall - it’s really OK. It’s a good phone but probably not much better than any other good smart phone.",4,2017-12-21 19:45:00
"268","Upgrade","Made an upgrade from a 6s to an 8. Same size as a 6 but additional features. Not fond of the new pricing policies, but that is manufacturer and vender issue, nothing to do with Best Buy. They only deliver the product and do a good job at it",5,2018-08-04 10:50:00

The phone is very similar to the I6s, except there are two speakers making the sound quality better when using the “loudspeaker”. 
The camera is supposed to be better, but I can’t tell the difference between that and the I6s. I wish it had a portrait photo mode that automatically blurs the background. Androids have portrait mode.",4,2017-12-21 07:51:00

If I had to recommend to a friend, I’d say hold of on 8 and get the 7 until the next 8se comes out in 6 months with more advance features.",4,2017-11-03 17:03:00

It's basically the same phone with a better camera and force touch, plus all the other new bells and whistles. I debated on getting the X but wasn't that impressed with face id and I'd have missed the home button too much. My first iPhone was the 4 and lasted me until the 6 came out and now I got the 8, which is better longevity than any of the android phones we've had. Battery lasts super long now which is great, camera is nice, the gold is pretty. New (to me) home button takes some getting used to, specifically that touch id so so super fast now that it takes me to my home screen when I really just wanted to quick check my notifications on my lock screen or swipe to take a photo. I need to get used to just picking it up and tilting it instead.",5,2018-01-12 14:08:00

"1034","Same old IPhone","Don’t see much difference, I chose the 8 over the X since I didn’t care for face recognition (I think that’s what you call it), plus I’m not an FBI agent or CIA hiding top secrets or any crazy girlfriend. I would have kept my 6 but you know, Apple seems to slow old phones down for some... reason. I also have all my media on apple, therefore I remained with apple (plus I needed more storage), though the Galaxy & other PC friendly phones look better.

"1622","Perfect.","My wife has been rocking a flip-phone since 2014. Recent events required that we upgrade our phones. She selected the iPhone 8 because she's an Apple lover. Yes, we know there's an iPhone X. Big deal. We don't conduct our lives over cell phones, unlike many of you. First and foremost, it integrated seamlessly with her other Apple toys -- her Mac, her iPod and her iPad, which was a plus, without her having to do anything at all. Also, the features and amenities are first-class and the camera is very near DSLR quailty. But we use it for making and receiving calls, mostly. After all, it's a PHONE.

It does a have a bigger battery than the iphone 8 but you would never know it. I missed the iphone and decided to come back. No regrets at all! In fact I believe this is the best phone I've ever owned. Battery life, ease of use, quality hardware and software --- all of it is just exceptional. Apple knew what they were doing on this one. I am happy to be back with iphone and don't intend to leave again. I do like many things about Android but I found myself customizing android to be like Apple.

This is a solid reliable phone with a great camera and 64GB has enough storage for my music and photos. Upgrade from the old phone to the new phone was an easy task. I chose the all black finish and am very satisfied with my purchase. I've upgraded phones for my family multiple times with Best Buy and have always had excellent service and helpful advice in restructuring the data plans.",5,2018-11-16 17:30:00
"1655","Nice upgrade","I am not one to run out a grab the newest phone and I actually planned to keep using my Iphone 6 until it died but my son's phone was not working so I finally gave in and used my upgrade so he could have my old phone. It's definitely nice to have a new phone again that has a decent battery life and the camera does seem to be quite a bit nicer on the Iphone 8. The touch screen seems to be quite a bit more sensitive, which I'm not crazy about but that might be something I can adjust once I play with the phone a bit more. No complaints yet.",5,2018-11-02 13:49:00
"1656","Very good Phone.","Nice upgrade for me. Old phone was an Apple so the transition to the new one was easy as operating the phone is basically the same. Still getting use to some of the new features but not an issue. The larger screen is great and still compact enough for keeping in pockets. I'm really enjoying the battery life. I don't think my old phone was this good when it was new. The Best Buy associate was really knowledgable and helpful when I was determining what I would purchase and made all the corrections I needed with my service provider. The service I received was a big plus in addition to the features I like about the phone itself.",5,2018-06-23 14:41:00
"1657","Nice phone fair price.","When my IPhone 6 got to the point it wouldn’t hold a charge it was time to get a new one, since I didn’t want to spend a small fortune on a IPhone 10 this phone was a good economical choice. The #8 does everything I need a phone to do and it didn’t “break the bank”. Service at my local Best Buy was excellent and the associate I dealt with was very helpful. I highly recommend Best Buy for all electronic purchases.",5,2019-12-14 14:44:00
"1658","Sometimes Simple Is Better","My wife loves the simplicity of the iPhone 8. Size it tough to beat and the performance and battery life is still good. If you don't need all the wiz bang features of the X or XS then the iPhone 8 is still a great phone at a great price.",5,2019-06-07 12:25:00

"1660","Good Phone. Held up well on long trek.","Took my new iPhone 8 on a 10 day, 100 mile hike to Mount Rainier in Washington state. It worked well overall. Photos came out fantastic. It held up well under rough trail conditions even after I dropped it. Glad I had a screen protector though. Screen protector cracked, but the glass itself did not. I suspect under normal drop conditions the phone will hold up well. It would have gotten five stars if the battery performed just a tad better when it got cold on the trails. I know the cold saps a battery charge, but being a brand new phone, I thought the battery should have lasted just a bit longer than it did. When we were in warmer temps, battery charge lasted many many hours. Overall though, I'm happy with the phone and it performed admirably at high elevations.",4,2018-09-02 05:53:00
"1661","Worst Phones ever! Just Buy Samsung","We upgraded from the iPhone 7 because the 7 was messing up, so we just decided to go with this phone.

Going with Samsung from now on.",1,2018-03-28 16:32:00
"1662","Love this Phone","I am usually an early adopter but had passed on an iPhone 7 in lieu of the 8 that was to be released not too long after I was able to upgrade. I opted for the maximum storage capacity. It is solidly made, the new features (especially the camera) are incredible, and I can’t say enough positive things about this phone. If you don’t want to spend the significant amounts of money for an iPhone X, the 8 is a really great alternative.",5,2017-11-25 08:36:00
"1663","Excellent upgrade!","Bought this after owning iPhone SE and it is excellent! Colors are great and it is fast. Great clarity on phone. Only drawback is no headphone jack.

"1667","Great phone!","I upgraded from in iPhone 6s to this iPhone 8, and love it. Great battery life, camera, screen resolution! The only thing I didn't think about ahead of time was that since it's a red phone, I can't see the red line when I switch to silent! So I have to remember that when the switch is close to the screen, volume is on, and when it's away from the screen volume is off (vibrate only). Hope I don't forget when I'm in class!!",5,2018-07-24 10:56:00
"1668","Ordered online and picked up in store","Store pick up made the process of upgrading a phone very simple and fast. You go into the store and get out without having to wait in line. The design of the phone is beautiful and quality of pictures makes it worth it",5,2019-04-08 00:15:00

"1671","Learning curve","I like the new photo options and battery life compared to the iPhone 5 I had, but this one is an inch longer and 1/2"" wider in its Otter Box. Some pockets in women's wear won't hold it. The screen also seems to dim faster, and I can't hear a tone for texts even though I fixed the settings for it. I did need the bigger memory, so that will be the biggest plus in the long term. Given the choices, this was better for my old-lady needs than an X model!",4,2018-12-28 14:51:00
"1672","Great phone","Easy to use, light weight and pictures come out great.",5,2019-09-27 15:50:00
"1673","Nice phone.","I waited to review this phone until I had it for a while. So far I like it quite a bit. It’s definitely way nicer than any other iPhone I’ve had. The camera is nice, takes great photos. The only complaint I have is every now and then when typing a text message the key board freezes. You have to close the app down and re-open to get it to work again. Over though it’s definately a nice phone for what I use it for.",4,2018-06-24 07:40:00
"1674","Love the space and camera","I went from a 4 to an 8. Bigger but not too much so. Was happily surprised by the Live Photo. Really cool. Still getting used to the top button being moved to the side. Love the space. I can take as many pictures as I want. Few other things that are kind of quirky that I need to figure out how to fix. Mostly with the Bluetooth. It switches to the phone when asking her to send text but when I try again it works.",4,2019-01-13 11:53:00
"1675","great transition phone","After clinging onto my 6S for years, i decided i needed a phone with stronger glass but didn’t want anything crazy expensive or fancy. This is a great 6S-but-better device. The transition to being headphone jackless hurts a little bit less as I am still familiar with the phone itself (although i do miss getting to use my headphones while charging my phone, but i can get an adapter or pods). The phone feels more luxurious, from the slimmer design and quicker, nicer screen, even with its more frequent vibrate home button click thing (sorry i don’t know the term). Going from 16GB of storage to 256 is a dream, but that is just a personal bonus.",5,2018-09-28 12:38:00
"1676","My Husband Loves This Phone","My husband loves this phone so much that when it was time for an upgrade he chose to keep his phone. That should show you right there what s great phone it is. Easy to use, great photos! He just loves it!",5,2019-03-20 18:37:00
"1677","My new favorite toy","Finally moved on from my 4s, and I’m loving the size and features of this iPhone 8! The size is perfect for me - and photo quality is great for taking cute shots of the grandkids. It was well worth the cost, which wasn’t too bad - after the $100 off from Verizon, and the Best Buy deal for accessories helped a lot. So glad I made the leap, I’ve been looking for a while, and the sales guy at Best Buy sold me, by answering all my questions patiently, and making great suggestions.",5,2018-01-18 02:35:00
"1678","weak battery and screen","Battery only lasts 4 hours with somewhat heavy usage, 8 hours with normal usage, barely 24 hours with very light usage, mostly with WIFI off. I imagine streaming a 2 hour movie would deplete 90% of a brand new battery. But at least it doesn't shutdown suddenly at 18% like they used to. 
Screen gets scratched alarmingly easily, seriously must be either pocket lint or cash bills scratching it. Scratches are not noticeable when screen is actually on though. For the cost of these things, the screen glass should be much more durable to scratching. 
Software is typical apple software, some cool features, some annoying, some ridiculous, not as intuitive or perfect as fanatics would have you believe, but comfortably secure, though not in a privacy sense, apple is about as bad as google and facebook in wanting to know every detail of your life and make ads a part of your life. 
Would I recommend, meh, if an android user was on the fence about switching, I'd tell them apple certainly isn't perfect and is kind of tyrannical, intrusive, and over-hyped, but more secure from hackers. I'd also mention how apple sabotages old devices, that really irks me and made getting another iphone a really difficult decision, still worry this new iphone might only be at it's best for a couple years. If someone was going from iphone 7 to 8, I'd ask why bother.
Oh, also still upset that they omitted the 3.5mm audio jack, that's an example of what I mean by tyrannical.",2,2019-01-11 15:50:00

She loves her iPhone. I decided to take the buy an iPhone X get an iPhone 8 free offer. She got the X! She is so happy and I have to say I really like the 8.

Like all Apple products, the software and hardware work very well together (efficient), and it interact seamlessly with my Mac Book and iPad. Powerful processor that allows me to easily multitask and switch between tasks quickly. I really don't have anything bad to say about the iPhone 8.",5,2019-10-27 10:56:00
"1684","Just a new iPhone","I came from a 5 so it’s a big step up a lot faster and more features. I don’t think the reception is any better for calls. I set it up with iCloud and was easy. If you have Apple Music make sure you have playlists turned on in the library home screen. That setting didn’t seem to transfer from backup. Verizon was a pain, I had to call 800 automated line to activate. The information was right online but just would not take.",5,2018-01-11 13:12:00
"1685","Nice upgrade from iPhone 6s!","Bought this after owning iPhone 6s and it is excellent! Colors are great and it is fast. Great clarity on phone. Only drawback is no headphone jack. Same size as iPhone 6, 6s, and 7 and same cases can be used on all of them. Good battery strength and charges quickly. Comes with AC adapter and headphones with lightning adapter, instead of headphone jack, and lightning cable.",5,2018-03-16 16:20:00
"1686","As always, amazing!","I’m definitely an Apple junkie, in other words, all of my technology is Apple. 
Prior to getting my iPhone 8, I had an iPhone 6. I feel the iPhone 6, 7, and 8 are pretty comparable in looks and features. I had already downloaded the new software on my iPhone 6 prior to upgrading, so I basically saw what my new iPhone 8 would be like. 
Despite the models being fairly similar, I’m definitely still happy with my upgrade. Obviously the phone itself is faster and doesn’t experience as many glitches as older models. 
I have experience a few issues with software updating, to the point where it’s had go into recovery mode. I have my phone backed up, so it’s not a huge downfall, just annoying. 
I definitely feel the Touch ID settings are much more accurate and easier to use opposed to older models. 
I have the gold model and I have to say I love the color! The back is also a glass material as opposed to the old metal casing. 
This material definitely feels more durable. I have a cheap and compact case on my phone, and it has still survived my toddler throwing it on our wood floor! 
If screen size is what you’re looking for, I would definitely go with a plus or X model. For me, I like that the regular model is small enough to hold in one hand, but still has a decent screen size. 
For it being the brand new model, I definitely love my 8 despite the software glitches and updates!",5,2018-02-05 17:22:00
"1687","Iphone 8, greatness","My Iphone 7 died on me, so went ahead and upgraded to the Iphone 8, love how fast it is, and the camera seems to take a lot better pictures. Didn't care for the IPhone X, wanted to keep my home button feature. So I would say this is my favorite Iphone yet, go and get yourself one or upgrade if you haven't already.",5,2018-07-06 12:33:00

"1691","Great phone","I've always been a fan of Apple products, and the new Iphone 8 is no exception. It has a great camera. The battery life is fantastic (unless you are FaceTiming which drains the battery faster). I thought I wouldn't like the no headphone jack gimmick, but nowadays most headphones are wireless anyways or you can use the headphone jack adapter, which really isn't as burdensome as I thought.",5,2017-12-21 08:50:00
"1692","Nice Upgrade from 5c","My old 5c was still working but short on memory. Got the iPhone 8 and it faster and has great features. Saving $100 at Bestbuy made the purchase easier. Transferring from the old to new iPhone went easy at Bestbuy.",5,2018-11-16 12:19:00
"1693","Traded a Samsung Note 8 to Get Back to iPhone","Late last year, I decided to follow the hype and go with the Samsung Note 8. It is a beautiful phone. However, the OS is not as seamless as an iPhone. I found myself missing group message from my iPhone using family; what a pain to actually have to dial into voicemail; trying to listen to MY OWN MUSIC was quite an adventure. Not as smooth as iTunes. So after a year, I decided to switch back to the iPhone and I couldn't be happier. The iPhone 8 is blazing fast, the apps are spectacular and battery life is really good. I am truly happy that I switch back.",5,2018-06-26 02:19:00

"1697","Solid phone except home button","This is a super solid phone that still holds up with the new iOS. My biggest gripe is that the home button does not recognize my finger print half of the time only after a year of usage. It’s pretty annoying but doesn’t stop me from accomplishing most of goals with the device. If you are debating getting this phone or the XR, I’d probably spend the extra bucks for the XR. It’ll stay in the iOS upgrade game that much longer and no more home button.",4,2019-12-17 23:45:00

At the end of the day its still just an iPhone. Same excellent call quality (yes! some of us still ""talk"" on a phone) and the same iOS interface we have all come to either love or hate.


If you have an iPhone, it is a nice upgrade. If you have a Droid an like that OS and can live with the iffy call quality, you should stick with a Droid.

The 8 is a beautiful phone with more storage, smoother transitions in apps, and great battery life. Im not all the way into the whole screen button thing. but my biggest frustration is the requirement for wireless earphones in order to charge. I mean, out of the box you can not listen to the ear buds and charge. I'm sure there are adapters to allow you to do it, but it's taking some adjusting. I won't die. (First world problems).

Other than this - it's not too much different from the 6 or 7 - except for the obvious upgrades in capability and memory. So far no problems or quirks. Everything's working great.",5,2019-01-20 15:07:00
"1886","It's an iPhone!","So it's an iPhone, what more needs to be said? I've used iPhones for many years. In the middle or last year I made the swithch to google phones; the pixel 2 then the 3. Decent phones, no doubt and a pure android experience. However, I missed the perfection that iPhone offers in it's OS. I am not one who cares all that much about customization; if something works well then let it work. I will say this about the iPhone 8 -- I am so very impressed with the battery. In my opinion and experience it lasts longer than the pixels. Pixel batteries are larger, to be sure. But they have to do more. iPhone batter and system just work well together and are far more efficient. Just to give you an example; I took my phone off the charger yesterday at 9:30 am. It is now 11:30 am (the next day) and I have 25% batter left on it, with a good deal of usage, the same as I would have used on a pixel phone. My previous pixel phone would have been dead long ago. The iPhone is still going. This is impressive.",5,2019-02-01 10:36:00

"1889","Great phone good pics","Phone has been great so far. The camera is a nice upgrade coming from the iphone6",4,2018-01-17 21:09:00
"1890","My first apple product","This is the first APPLE product i’ve ever owned. I switched from having android over to APPLE just to try it out, and I like it. Usually would own Samsung phones, but like them both equally. One feature I really like is being able to turn on/ off the data for each individual app with the iphone8.",5,2018-12-30 17:51:00
"1891","The Right Phone for Me","When I finally resolved to upgrade from my iPhone 5S, the decision came down to the 8, 8+, or X. I went with the 8 because I preferred the more compact size, and didn't feel like the extra $300 justified the facial recognition, better camera, etc. that the iPhone X offers. I went with 64G because I don't store a lot of content (music, videos, etc.) on my phone; I keep most of my content library in iCloud and download as needed.

So far, I'm really liking this phone, but there has been one issue: poor cellular reception in my house, which has also been a problem for my wife with her iPhone 6. This was never an issue with my 5S but there have been multiple occasions with the iPhone 8 where people have had difficulty hearing me (although I could hear them fine). It could be a Verizon issue or it could be a phone issue, I'm not sure. Will try to post an update once I have more info.",4,2017-12-30 06:26:00

"1894","Apple Doesn't Disappoint","I went into Best Buy looking for a new phone. I had the Apple iPhone SE and needed an upgrade. I was between the iPhone 8 and the Samsung. After looking over the two phones, I decided to stay with Apple. I got it in red and I absolutely love the color! I was worried that the new phone would be too big, but it's still a good size and I feel comfortable holding it and using it. I get to keep all my apps and I like the camera too!",5,2018-06-21 05:56:00

"1898","iPhone 8 is perfect upgrade from a dumb phone","My husband and I went together to upgrade from our Samsung Brightside phones to a smart phone. The transition was fairly easy.

"1902","Similar to the iPhone 6","This was an upgrade/replacement for my shattered iPhone 6. The home button being part of the screen (and no longer physically clicking down when you push on it) is not an issue for people who prefer it - there's a setting to set that gives a tactile response as if you clicked on it. I've always used cute/cheap cases from eBay/Amazon, but since this phone has a GLASS back, a more dependable case is required. Also, I don't love the removal of the headphone jack. I need to buy more accessories to let me continue to use my FM transmitter in my car and a splitter to be able to charge and listen to music at the same time.",4,2018-06-30 14:16:00
"1903","Great Apple Product","Love the iPhone 8. Camera quality is great. Easy to use software.",4,2017-12-20 16:44:00
"1904","So far so good","I went from a 6 to an 8 and I’m very happy with my upgrade, it’s the same size as the 6 so didn’t need to buy new phone cases.

"1906","Great as usual.","I’m using this as my work phone, and have the X as my personal phone. This replaced an iPhone 5 that I had for a few years. I like this one a lot better due to the size increase from the 5. Much easier to text, email, etc. Haven’t had any issues with it whatsoever!",5,2018-12-19 17:26:00
"1907","Easy to use phone","My husband was in need of a new phone,....He is not technology savvy. We went to Best Buy and spoke with an associate, about usage and navigating the iPhone 8, to my husband surprise he picked up on most of the phones capabilities right away..we are so happy with our purchase.",5,2018-11-28 18:12:00
"1908","Fantastic iPhone","The iPhone 8 is a fantastic smartphone and I’m happy with the upgrade in memory capacity. Having 256 gb is great for a person like myself with a great deal of music on their phone. The iPhone 8 is of a sleek sturdy design and the new glass back feature makes it capable of wireless charging on a pad. Fast processing.",5,2018-09-27 08:07:00

"1910","Great phone","Yes, I am an Apple fanboy. However, there’s a reason...compatibility. I own many Apple products and the ease of use is exceptional. Great size phone for my child and easy to use. iOS 12 enables screen time monitoring which I love. The speakers are decent on the phone and resolution is great.",5,2018-10-28 08:51:00
"1911","Typical iPhone - Just Works!","I have had 3 iPhones and love the way they just work. I know many of the Android phones compete and maybe even have more features. I have thought about switching at times. The thing that keeps me coming back is incremental improvements to a great phone that works. The breadth of the app store is incomparable. The iPhone 8 isn't much different from the previous generation, but it does seem to be a lot faster. It has good battery life. I miss the headphone jack but am finding ways to work around the change.",5,2017-10-07 07:59:00
"1912","Just an average user","I am not a avid phone junkie. There are some that utilize their phones for just about everything . No judgment here just the way our society is today and to be honest I am not so much or perhaps just not as quick. I see lots of advantages from a iPhone 6 to the 8. The camera is a plus, The operating system is much more responsive and the cell reception in the north area of my city is much better as I have both of the MAIN cell services with multiple device that apple provides and do not think it has to do the service provider. All in all a great phone but a bit pricey as it comes from an old rather dapper chap ( if may add) like myself that finds himself more routinely saying, "" I remember when .... and in this case - "" I rember when I could get a cell phone for free....
hahahahah!",4,2017-10-30 09:27:00

"1919","Great phone!","I recently upgraded my iPhone 6 to the iPhone 8. It is the perfect size, not too big or heavy! The only thing I was hoping for was portrait mode on the camera. Other than that, phone is user friendly and downloads quickly.",5,2018-12-19 21:20:00
"1920","Love the red color and the price","The iPhone 8 is very good. The battery life could be better, but the features and functions are excellent for my needs. I liked buying from Best Buy. Quick, efficient and helpful. And BB was running a promotion - they do that much more frequently than the Verizon store. Very good experience.",5,2018-08-20 07:13:00
"1921","My review about my iPhone 8","It's a good phone it has great camera quality and I like how it's designed and the way it looks and the variety of colors you can choose from when you buy an iPhone and i also like how most stores carry iPhone accessories when it comes to phone cases and things like that but the only thing I don't like about iPhone is the battery and how it doesn't have a Headphone jack but other than that I think it's a great phone. I have to keep a charge close because the battery doesn't last that long.",4,2018-07-19 22:33:00

"1925","Surprises","We have had our new iPhone 8's for about 2 weeks now. They are great, look good, battery life is exceptional. The problem came with the switch we made from Android to Apple. Wish I would have researched more or had been informed about how differently i phones use data. Yikes! Suddenly texting used all of our data, so the learning curve is about much more than opening and closing apps. We have made some changes to settings, but this is not what I expected. Otherwise, the phone is great.",4,2018-07-08 09:28:00

It seems faster than my 6S, and I like the Home button being electronic instead of physical.

"2053","Beat my expectations!!","I have to admit, I was hesitant to buy this phone at first. I was coming from an iPhone 6s 64gb, and I didn't see too much in the way of upgrade features. 

Well suffice it to say, I've been pleasantly surprised. For starters, it's nice to return back to the glass enclosure that earlier iterations of the iPhone had. It just feels like it gives the phone a more premium look. Also, it could just be me, but the colors on the iPhone 8 blow away those from my 6s. It just seems like the colors pop a lot more on this new phone. Best yet, as childish as this may sound, the Space Gray color on this phone is true to form. The Space Gray on my 6s was more silver looking to me. Overall, very happy with this new phone and I highly recommend it!!",5,2018-02-21 19:23:00

"2476","A great phone.","Probably not worth it if you're upgrading from an iPhone 7, but if you're doing the Verizon payment plan, why not, right?

Upgrades are:

- Faster processor
- Wireless charging (this method charges very slowly; only beneficial overnight)
- (I think) faster cable charging. I can usually get 80% battery life in about an hour.
- Slightly better camera

That's really it. I upgraded from that iPhone SE, and that seemed very fast (it ran the same processor as a 6S). I mean honestly, at a certain point faster processors won't matter.

The glass back is very pretty, but the outer rim is still aluminum so it is very prone to dents. 

Everyone is waiting for the iPhone X anyway... haha.",4,2017-09-28 17:06:00
