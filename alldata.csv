"6",6,"Great Camera","As the iPhones have evolved, so have the cameras. The optical zoom feature, up to 10x, is great. I took a sunset photo of the Pacific with a resulting photo that rivals my digital camera (which is why I rarely use that camera).",5,2018-02-22 07:52:00,"iphone8"
"7",7,"Great phone, good size (not TOO big); no probs.","Upgrading from an old iPhone 5s, only thing I really had to adjust to was the new home button and the sleep/wake button being on the side rather than on the top.  At first, because of sleep button being on the side and the way I hold the phone, I found that I would also depress one of the volume buttons at the same time as e sleep button, so it wouldn't work - quickly realized what I was doing and that there was nothing wrong with the phone, and am more careful now.  Significantly faster, clearer and much better sound than the old phone.  Shoulda got it sooner!  Also got it cheaper at Best Buy than from Apple.",5,2019-08-23 16:37:00,"iphone8"
"8",8,"Love the “home” button and size.","The staff helped me transition from an Android system to Apple. While the product is an important part, the personal service from everyone is what sends me to Best Buy. They knew the products, were courteous and gave explanations without pushing me towards an item. Once I had decided on the I Phone 8, features were pointed out and how to use them. I find the phone to be what I need and love that I have a “home” button.",5,2019-05-19 08:04:00,"iphone8"
"9",9,"iPhone 8 vs iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone SE, & iPhone X.","I have recent experience using both the iPhone SE and iPhone 6s Plus. The Plus model was too big since I use a case with a belt clip to carry the phone, and the SE's screen was a bit too small. I am going to compare my review of the iPhone 8 (purchased unlocked at full price and used with Verizon prepaid) mostly to the iPhone 6s Plus, but one has to understand that the SE especially at prepaid price is an excellent, outstanding phone too with almost all of the same features as the Plus!) 

Pros:

The iPhone 8 is an upgrade in a few ways. Apple includes a compare feature on its website so I won't go into all of the details, but I will try to address the ones that are upgrades to the iPhone 6s Plus. 

True Tone display does make the screen easier to read because the lighting isn't as harsh. This is coming from someone who has vision problems and prefers the ""daylight"" bulbs because I need good lighting to see.

This phone features water resistance, which means one can now uses cases that might provide better protection or do not muffle sound. With that said, I use a Ghostek Nautical 2 case also sold through BestBuy. It provides great protection combined with waterproofing. Since I use hearing aids to stream audio, sound being muffled isn't an issue and people can hear me clearly.

The camera specs *seem* to be similar, but I can see a difference! The pictures are clearer, sharper, and more detailed. Also, this smaller model has the optical image stabilization for the video too. To get the best quality video, I shoot in 4K even though the final output will be in 1080p. Larger files won't take up as much room on this model thanks to upgraded compression features. This model includes an improved flash too.

The sound quality on the iPhone 8 seems to be louder and clearer. There is a front speaker too.

With my previous phones I also used battery cases. The iPhone 8 with the same use seems to get me through the whole day, but I plan to buy an external battery charger that will also allow me to charge wirelessly soon.

Neutral:

The bluetooth is supposed to be an upgrade. I am not sure if this is a hardware of software issue with iOS 11 through 11.2.1. At the time of this writing, I am having some issues with it. With phone calls, my made for iPhone hearing aids do not work as well. Sometimes only one connects. Other times I notice a periodic static or crackling sound.

Areas for Improvement:

What I do not like about the IPhone 8 is the glass back because of how it is designed. In my opinion, it is a very poor design choice, and what weighted the most heavily on my decision to knock star off the overall rating. It is almost half of the cost of the phone without insurance to replace this! The iPhone 4s has a glass back too. However, one could remove two screws and slide off the back, which means the back plate and battery were easily replaced.

A fast charging wall adapter was not included in this premium priced phone. I use a Belkin (also sold through BestBuy) or iPad one instead of the one included with great results.

Without a case, the ""gold"" looks like rose gold around the edges and several shades lighter on the back. It looks expensive and stylish, but this look disappears with a case. I miss my Rose Gold that could be seen even through a clear back case.

Comments:

I didn't wait for the iPhone X. I think the technology behind the facial recognition features is impressive. However, without Touch ID too, I am willing to wait to see how this works out and will decide again when I upgrade next time. I would prefer the bigger iPhone screen on a smaller size. The built-in portrait features are a plus, but I can do most of that with software. These three differences were not worth the price difference to me.

Overall Conclusion:

I am enjoying using my IPhone 8 with improves on previous models, and it was the best overall choice for me.",4,2017-12-24 08:59:00,"iphone8"
"10",10,"Works as expected.","This is a replacement for another iPhone that lost a battle with a stair step.  My daughter goes to school in another state so we went to BB on a Saturday, she received it in the mail on Tuesday, activation and set up for her was a snap, and she was up and running in no time.  It works as expected with no further issues.",5,2019-11-15 16:30:00,"iphone8"
"11",11,"A great Apple phone that fits in your back pocket!","I was so sad when my SE’s  recently stopped working, and I had to send it to the recycle pile.
I didn’t want a phone that was bigger than my palm & found the iPhone 8 had almost everything on my list. 
The only thing that I don’t like about this phone, although I know I’ll get used to it is, the on button is no longer on the top right corner of the phone, but on it’s right side.
It’s also slightly larger, but still fits in my hand & back pocket, which was a must for me. 
Like I mentioned before, I’ll get used to it in time. Overall, I’m very satisfied with my purchase.",4,2019-10-29 05:59:00,"iphone8"
"12",12,"Great Replacement for Iphone 5S","Similar in size to the previous model but twice the memory and a faster chip speed. Wireless charging ready. Easy to transfer data from old IPhone to new iPhone. My wife loves it!",5,2019-12-26 10:37:00,"iphone8"
"13",13,"Home Button","Good value if you want to have a phone with the home button and get into the Apple ecosystem at a reasonable price.  The phone will last 3-4 years before they cut iOS support.",5,2020-01-27 12:24:00,"iphone8"
"14",14,"Huge improvement over my last phone","I don’t upgrade to the latest and greatest. Moving up from a 5s to this is an amazing upgrade. Love the size and the storage capacity. No more deleting photos or songs to create more room",5,2019-12-31 15:04:00,"iphone8"
"15",15,"Good device for the price","I bought this as an upgrade from an iPhone 6. There’s no doubt that this is a better phone, in all aspects. It’s fast, wireless charging is a cool feature, and it’s nice to have 64 GB of storage. I do have some regret that I didn’t get the iPhone X, but it really came down to price. The iPhone 8 was on sale, at the time of purchase, and was half the cost of the X.

Pros:
- 64 GB storage is ample (at least for now). Definitely a breath of fresh air after dealing with 16 GB and constant storage management. 
- The phone is fast. The A11 chip seems really responsive. Apps open quickly, on-screen animations/transitions are seamless, and it just feels fluid in your hands. 
- It has a good camera. 12 MP is really all I need for the photos I take. It’s definitely not the best phone camera around, but is a noticeable upgrade from the iPhone 6. 
- Wireless charging. The reason I had to upgrade is because the charging port on my last phone broke. It’s nice that I don’t have to worry about wearing out this phone’s port. Wireless charging is convenient and seems to power up the phone just as quick as plugging it in. 

Cons:
- This phone feels outdated (because it is). I really don’t care too much about having the latest features and an all-screen front. But, if it wasn’t for the upgraded home button and the revised Space Gray color, I wouldn’t know if I was holding an iPhone 8 or 6. 
- The lack of a headphone jack is disappointing. Yes, I can get an adapter or Bluetooth and I will probably get used to it, in time. But, it’s kind of a pain, at the moment. 

Overall, I like this phone. It definitely lacks the modern features and ‘feel’ that other current phones have, but it is a good performer. If you are a fan of Apple phones, need to upgrade, and are looking to save some cash, I would recommend it.",4,2019-06-22 06:29:00,"iphone8"

"23",23,"Love this phone!","I recently upgraded to the iPhone 8 from a 5s. It's great. I love that Apple products are pretty seamless in terms of transitions. I had no problem starting up my new phone from a previous backup of my old phone. All contacts, apps, photos, etc. appeared on my new phone with no issue. It was an adjustment from the 5s because I had it for 3 or 4 years, but I keep my phones a long time. I definitely recommend a screen shield and nice case. Small investments that keep your phone like new for a long time. There are some cool new features with this phone that I haven't quite mastered like 3D touch and Portrait mode. 3D touch worked in the store with the sales person coaching me, but I didn't master it before I left so now I can't get it (again more so user error than anything). Also portrait mode isn't showing up in the camera options and I have updated the phone since I bought it. Other than that, I love the phone and love the service I received at Best Buy during purchase.",5,2017-12-15 11:17:00,"iphone8"
"24",24,"Its better than my Flip Phone!","SO I went shopping with a elderly lady who was trading in her flip phone for a new smart phone since her family thought this would be a great way for them to keep in touch. We stopped at Target first since they had a $200 gift card available when you purchased an IPHONE 8. Come to find out, Target hasn't had this phone in stock since November and the sale was void. We decided to stop at Best Buy after this, and We worked with some of the nicest people ever. They recommended the IPHONE since my elderly lady already had an IPAD and this would be the easiest conversion to a smart phone since the apps and menu are the same. I really wish APPLE had EASY MODE but we did get the ICONS and APPS bigger and everyone is happy. Thanks!",5,2019-03-16 19:49:00,"iphone8"
"25",25,"Excellent!","The battery in my 6s was replaced once and the new battery never stayed charged so I  wanted a phone that was the same size with new features!   The 8 was the answer!   Very pleased!",5,2019-12-06 16:24:00,"iphone8"
"26",26,"Love my iPhone 8","So let me start by saying I have owned this phone for a year now and it's just as great as the day I first brought it home. I went for the 256GB version because I was tired of running out of space on my old iPhone 6. No memory issues now. There is a ton of space on this phone.
Lastly, I will say my family has purchased the iPhone X and they wish they would have went with the 8. I cannot explain the reasons behind their dislike of the X other than missing the button at the bottom. Anyway, they have convinced me to stick with my iPhone 8 for as long as I can and I honestly expect to have it for several more years.",5,2018-11-28 21:23:00,"iphone8"
"27",27,"Excellent incremental update","I won't go into specifics about the upgrade in this iteration of iPhone (you can find all of that on Apple's homepage), however I will say the incremental upgrades are noticeable and welcomed. I use the wireless charging everyday, the screen looks much ""richer"", and everything seems to be very snappy. However, I wouldn't say this was a significant upgrade from the 7 and wouldn't really be worth it (in my opinion) to go from a 7 to an 8.",5,2017-10-29 19:44:00,"iphone8"
"28",28,"Terrific phone!","If you can still buy them, this one is probably a great way to get an iPhone without sacrificing limbs to pay for the bloomin thing! Excellent product, as usual with Apple.",5,2019-12-02 21:39:00,"iphone8"

Wasn’t keen on shelling out $1000 or more for an X or whatever, and 8s were being sold new in the box. Has most of the newest features, aside from facial recognition. She’s thrilled with her new phone and I look heroic. Win-win!

One cool thing about the 8 that has me wanting one is the Qi wireless charging capability. We tried it with my daughter’s new 8 and it works as advertised!",5,2018-12-28 13:00:00,"iphone8"

"48",48,"Takes getting used to","Now that I've had my phone for 3 weeks, I'm beginning to like it a lot more. My last 2 iPhones were the 5S and SE, which were smaller and sturdier. I chose the 8 because of the price and because it fits into my bicycle phone case mount. With that being said, I'm not sure I want to take my phone on bike rides (not a good idea--what if something happens), since it's made of glass. The home button works differently than the other two phones, but thankfully I got Siri every time I punched the home button too hard, and she could help me out. Once you've paid for the protective coating for the screen and found a reasonable case that seems sturdy enough to protect the rest of this slimline phone, hope that's all you have to pay for. Also, I drive an older car with a bluetooth not recognized by the iPhone, so I had to buy a different auxiliary adapter, since the lightening port is different. This just means I can't recharge my phone and listen to music at the same time.",4,2019-02-13 11:45:00,"iphone8"

"61",61,"Helpful?","I have to wonder what may be the point of writing a review on a phone. The tribal mentality that is Android vs. iPhone has obfuscated any real discussion around fitting the right tool to function. 

Subjectively, and objectively as one can muster, it is redundant to say this is a beautiful functional top shelf device. The only thing I can offer to anyone on the fence is consider whether you are someone that ""needs"" your device... needs your phone to meld into the million parts of the daily kaleidoscope of your life, to find it's place in your own personal flurry.... or if you are someone that is buying the phone primarily as a daily fidget spinner of sorts; a electronic time killer to insulate the space between the minutes. To keep the walls warm between seasons.

Neither of those are ill things, nor does one always find themselves only in summer flurries or wedded to the cruel mistress of hurry up and wait. 

Do you need your device, or does your device need you?

The iPhone 8 is a stalwart servant to your court.

Fortunately, I met Jenn at the Apple area of Best Buy and she showed me the iPhone 8. I felt it was an overkill for my needs but I took a chance with it because of the great sale they had. Very glad that I did and EXTREMELY happy with my purchase. It's only been a couple of weeks but every day I am discovering something new with it's performance and functionality. I can't believe the difference of it's performance over the iPhone 5s. There have been a few glitches with updates but that is software and not the hardware. I've been an Apple user with laptops and phones for 8 years and yes, I'm biased. I'm confident in Apple taking care of the minor software update issues.",5,2018-03-03 10:13:00,"iphone8"

I guess the level of customization has improved, but I'm not sure about the faster speed or better camera (I use this mostly for calls, texts, and simple game apps (not as a mini computer).

I like the Plus- my last phone was standard size and I really love the larger screen. But it’s heavy. 
Sometimes the phone stops responding to touch screen for no apparent reason. This is concerning. And I may bring it up with Apple Support after a little google research.

The camera is supposed to be better, but I can’t tell the difference between that and the I6s. I wish it had a portrait photo mode that automatically blurs the background. Androids have portrait mode.",4,2017-12-21 07:51:00,"iphone8"

My first iPhone was the 4 and lasted me until the 6 came out and now I got the 8, which is better longevity than any of the android phones we've had. Battery lasts super long now which is great, camera is nice, the gold is pretty. New (to me) home button takes some getting used to, specifically that touch id so so super fast now that it takes me to my home screen when I really just wanted to quick check my notifications on my lock screen or swipe to take a photo.

Yes, we know there's an iPhone X. Big deal. We don't conduct our lives over cell phones, unlike many of you. First and foremost, it integrated seamlessly with her other Apple toys -- her Mac, her iPod and her iPad, which was a plus, without her having to do anything at all. Also, the features and amenities are first-class and the camera is very near DSLR quailty. But we use it for making and receiving calls, mostly. After all, it's a PHONE.

In fact I believe this is the best phone I've ever owned. Battery life, ease of use, quality hardware and software --- all of it is just exceptional. Apple knew what they were doing on this one.

It's definitely nice to have a new phone again that has a decent battery life and the camera does seem to be quite a bit nicer on the Iphone 8. The touch screen seems to be quite a bit more sensitive, which I'm not crazy about but that might be something I can adjust once I play with the phone a bit more.

I don't think my old phone was this good when it was new.

I highly recommend Best Buy for all electronic purchases.",5,2019-12-14 14:44:00,"iphone8"
"1658",1658,"Sometimes Simple Is Better","My wife loves the simplicity of the iPhone 8. Size it tough to beat and the performance and battery life is still good.

"1660",1660,"Good Phone. Held up well on long trek.","Took my new iPhone 8 on a 10 day, 100 mile hike to Mount Rainier in Washington state. It worked well overall. Photos came out fantastic. It held up well under rough trail conditions even after I dropped it. Glad I had a screen protector though. Screen protector cracked, but the glass itself did not. I suspect under normal drop conditions the phone will hold up well. It would have gotten five stars if the battery performed just a tad better when it got cold on the trails. I know the cold saps a battery charge, but being a brand new phone, I thought the battery should have lasted just a bit longer than it did. When we were in warmer temps, battery charge lasted many many hours. Overall though, I'm happy with the phone and it performed admirably at high elevations.",4,2018-09-02 05:53:00,"iphone8"

"1662",1662,"Love this Phone","I am usually an early adopter but had passed on an iPhone 7 in lieu of the 8 that was to be released not too long after I was able to upgrade. I opted for the maximum storage capacity. It is solidly made, the new features (especially the camera) are incredible, and I can’t say enough positive things about this phone.

The only thing I didn't think about ahead of time was that since it's a red phone, I can't see the red line when I switch to silent! So I have to remember that when the switch is close to the screen, volume is on, and when it's away from the screen volume is off (vibrate only). Hope I don't forget when I'm in class!!",5,2018-07-24 10:56:00,"iphone8"
"1668",1668,"Ordered online and picked up in store","Store pick up made the process of upgrading a phone very simple and fast. You go into the store and get out without having to wait in line.

The camera is nice, takes great photos. The only complaint I have is every now and then when typing a text message the key board freezes.

"1675",1675,"great transition phone","After clinging onto my 6S for years, i decided i needed a phone with stronger glass but didn’t want anything crazy expensive or fancy. This is a great 6S-but-better device. The transition to being headphone jackless hurts a little bit less as I am still familiar with the phone itself (although i do miss getting to use my headphones while charging my phone, but i can get an adapter or pods). The phone feels more luxurious, from the slimmer design and quicker, nicer screen, even with its more frequent vibrate home button click thing (sorry i don’t know the term).

The size is perfect for me - and photo quality is great for taking cute shots of the grandkids. It was well worth the cost, which wasn’t too bad - after the $100 off from Verizon, and the Best Buy deal for accessories helped a lot. So glad I made the leap, I’ve been looking for a while, and the sales guy at Best Buy sold me, by answering all my questions patiently, and making great suggestions.",5,2018-01-18 02:35:00,"iphone8"
"1678",1678,"weak battery and screen","Battery only lasts 4 hours with somewhat heavy usage, 8 hours with normal usage, barely 24 hours with very light usage, mostly with WIFI off. I imagine streaming a 2 hour movie would deplete 90% of a brand new battery. But at least it doesn't shutdown suddenly at 18% like they used to. 
Screen gets scratched alarmingly easily, seriously must be either pocket lint or cash bills scratching it. Scratches are not noticeable when screen is actually on though. For the cost of these things, the screen glass should be much more durable to scratching. 
Software is typical apple software, some cool features, some annoying, some ridiculous, not as intuitive or perfect as fanatics would have you believe, but comfortably secure, though not in a privacy sense, apple is about as bad as google and facebook in wanting to know every detail of your life and make ads a part of your life. 
Would I recommend, meh, if an android user was on the fence about switching, I'd tell them apple certainly isn't perfect and is kind of tyrannical, intrusive, and over-hyped, but more secure from hackers. I'd also mention how apple sabotages old devices, that really irks me and made getting another iphone a really difficult decision, still worry this new iphone might only be at it's best for a couple years. If someone was going from iphone 7 to 8, I'd ask why bother.
Oh, also still upset that they omitted the 3.5mm audio jack, that's an example of what I mean by tyrannical.",2,2019-01-11 15:50:00,"iphone8"

Prior to getting my iPhone 8, I had an iPhone 6. I feel the iPhone 6, 7, and 8 are pretty comparable in looks and features. I had already downloaded the new software on my iPhone 6 prior to upgrading, so I basically saw what my new iPhone 8 would be like. 
Despite the models being fairly similar, I’m definitely still happy with my upgrade. Obviously the phone itself is faster and doesn’t experience as many glitches as older models. 
I have experience a few issues with software updating, to the point where it’s had go into recovery mode. I have my phone backed up, so it’s not a huge downfall, just annoying. 
I definitely feel the Touch ID settings are much more accurate and easier to use opposed to older models. 
I have the gold model and I have to say I love the color! The back is also a glass material as opposed to the old metal casing. 
This material definitely feels more durable. I have a cheap and compact case on my phone, and it has still survived my toddler throwing it on our wood floor! 
If screen size is what you’re looking for, I would definitely go with a plus or X model. For me, I like that the regular model is small enough to hold in one hand, but still has a decent screen size. 
For it being the brand new model, I definitely love my 8 despite the software glitches and updates!",5,2018-02-05 17:22:00,"iphone8"

However, the OS is not as seamless as an iPhone. I found myself missing group message from my iPhone using family; what a pain to actually have to dial into voicemail; trying to listen to MY OWN MUSIC was quite an adventure. Not as smooth as iTunes. So after a year, I decided to switch back to the iPhone and I couldn't be happier. The iPhone 8 is blazing fast, the apps are spectacular and battery life is really good.

At the end of the day its still just an iPhone. Same excellent call quality (yes! some of us still ""talk"" on a phone) and the same iOS interface we have all come to either love or hate.


If you have an iPhone, it is a nice upgrade. If you have a Droid an like that OS and can live with the iffy call quality, you should stick with a Droid.

I am not one who cares all that much about customization; if something works well then let it work. I will say this about the iPhone 8 -- I am so very impressed with the battery. In my opinion and experience it lasts longer than the pixels. Pixel batteries are larger, to be sure. But they have to do more. iPhone batter and system just work well together and are far more efficient. Just to give you an example; I took my phone off the charger yesterday at 9:30 am. It is now 11:30 am (the next day) and I have 25% batter left on it, with a good deal of usage, the same as I would have used on a pixel phone. My previous pixel phone would have been dead long ago. The iPhone is still going. This is impressive.",5,2019-02-01 10:36:00,"iphone8"

"1891",1891,"The Right Phone for Me","When I finally resolved to upgrade from my iPhone 5S, the decision came down to the 8, 8+, or X. I went with the 8 because I preferred the more compact size, and didn't feel like the extra $300 justified the facial recognition, better camera, etc. that the iPhone X offers. I went with 64G because I don't store a lot of content (music, videos, etc.) on my phone; I keep most of my content library in iCloud and download as needed.

So far, I'm really liking this phone, but there has been one issue: poor cellular reception in my house, which has also been a problem for my wife with her iPhone 6. This was never an issue with my 5S but there have been multiple occasions with the iPhone 8 where people have had difficulty hearing me (although I could hear them fine). It could be a Verizon issue or it could be a phone issue, I'm not sure. Will try to post an update once I have more info.",4,2017-12-30 06:26:00,"iphone8"

The home button being part of the screen (and no longer physically clicking down when you push on it) is not an issue for people who prefer it - there's a setting to set that gives a tactile response as if you clicked on it. I've always used cute/cheap cases from eBay/Amazon, but since this phone has a GLASS back, a more dependable case is required. Also, I don't love the removal of the headphone jack.

The iPhone 8 isn't much different from the previous generation, but it does seem to be a lot faster. It has good battery life.

No judgment here just the way our society is today and to be honest I am not so much or perhaps just not as quick. I see lots of advantages from a iPhone 6 to the 8. The camera is a plus, The operating system is much more responsive and the cell reception in the north area of my city is much better as I have both of the MAIN cell services with multiple device that apple provides and do not think it has to do the service provider. All in all a great phone but a bit pricey as it comes from an old rather dapper chap ( if may add) like myself that finds himself more routinely saying, "" I remember when .... and in this case - "" I rember when I could get a cell phone for free....

Well suffice it to say, I've been pleasantly surprised. For starters, it's nice to return back to the glass enclosure that earlier iterations of the iPhone had. It just feels like it gives the phone a more premium look. Also, it could just be me, but the colors on the iPhone 8 blow away those from my 6s. It just seems like the colors pop a lot more on this new phone. Best yet, as childish as this may sound, the Space Gray color on this phone is true to form.

Upgrades are:

- Faster processor
- Wireless charging (this method charges very slowly; only beneficial overnight)
- (I think) faster cable charging. I can usually get 80% battery life in about an hour.
- Slightly better camera

That's really it. I upgraded from that iPhone SE, and that seemed very fast (it ran the same processor as a 6S). I mean honestly, at a certain point faster processors won't matter.

"2485",1,"Solid Update & Great Performing Camera","Having owned my old iPhone 7 Plus for 3 years but still running great, I hadn’t thought much about buying another phone until the 11 Pro was announced. I liked what Apple offered on it and made the investment. I wasn’t disappointed and even surprised in other features like the fact it can use AT&Ts 5GE network which isn’t real 5G but LTE using multiple antennas to double up the bandwidth. Cool! As for the camera and battery, the reason I bought it, didn’t disappoint me. Taking pics is now a lot more powerful and faster yet keeps it simple and battery life helps enjoy it for longer as it’s the best I’ve ever had on any smartphone. I’ve been averaging about 15 hours of heavy usage in the last couple of days. Everything from enjoying music and videos, texting, phones calls, IG & Snapchat. Even did some video editing after capturing some video and taking pictures. I’m sure I can improve the life once the novelty of it goes away and I don’t turn it on unnecessarily. LoL As always its way faster and the screen looks amazing in any light. Though a little heavier than any phone I’ve used, the Midnight Green looks awesome in my opinion. As to why I like using an iPhone, I know there are lots of choices running Android but the simplicity of taking pics and video, editing them and syncing them across my devices and posting them while on the move are key for me. So, that’s my take on the iPhone 11 Pro Max after the last 4 days.",5,2019-09-23 21:15:00,"iphone11promax"
"2486",2,"Pretty impressive!","I waited to upgrade my 8 plus even though i could have done so when the 11 was out. Watched alot of reviews  and finally upgraded about 2 weeks ago and oh boy iam impressed with the improvement on the camera department!although its not like day and night different! I could care less about other features tbh, to me the best camera is the one that you always have in your pocket. Thats why i upgraded and it was because i was due to upgrade. If i wasnt id rather wait untill my 8 plus paid off and skip this gen of iphone and wait for the 12 or something. The camera is worth the upgrade from my 8 plus but still i dont think it deserves the ridiculous 1250 dollar price tag. If you have the 8 plus or the x series and they are not paid off yet, trust me you can wait but if you want to be that guy/girl who always wants to have the latest and the greatest from apple and have tons of money to burn, well no one can stop you doesnt matter how many honest reviews you have read or watch.",5,2019-10-31 18:32:00,"iphone11promax"

The camera is awesome and the battery life is great. Fast charging is a complete game changing too. I know people will say Samsung is better but for me with everything I own is Apple this phone is perfect for me and I like the iOS VS android so IMO if you’re looking for a new phone with a great camera get this one.",5,2019-10-18 18:23:00,"iphone11promax"
"2488",4,"Wow! Just wow!","Ok, so I went from the X to this phone and was not sure if I’d see a real difference. But you can tell! I got the Max and while it does feel slightly larger it is not bad at all. My two big things I love is the camera at night and the battery life. 

I did multiple side by side pictures at night using the wife’s iPhone X and the 11. Noticeable difference. Some of the night pictures come out a little yellowish but it is still better than getting nothing like I was before. The two pictures below were in different lighting environments and they both came out great. The one of the vehicles was taken at about 4am with no lights on whatsoever.

"2500",16,"Best IPhone Yet","Remarkable features and sleek design with a powerful clear camera. The balance and weight of the device is fundamentally sound. Truly the fastest processor on any iPhone to date. Worth the buy/upgrade.",5,2019-12-14 12:30:00,"iphone11promax"
"2501",17,"Amazing Camera & Battery","So, at this point if you are not familiar with iOS and what iPhones are all about here comes a short summary. Apple iPhones are normally great hardware, build quality, and easy UI. Unlike Android, normally you don’t hear spec sheets on iPhone. RAM, battery size, processors are usually a mute point because they iPhone run iOS which can’t really compared to Android. Don’t get me wrong I’ve used many, many Android phones (most recently the Samsung Note 10+) and they have some amazing phones, with equally amazing cameras, and features. 

So, what sets this iPhone apart from the ones that have come before, even the XS, is the cameras are a huge step forward, and they battery is hard to kill. Most phones take great photos in optimal lighting conditions. What sets phones apart is how they handle low light, or night photography. Here is where this iPhone really shines. The images that this device is able to capture with little light is amazing. With Deep Fusion around the corner, you will also see an increase in detail in most photos that don’t use the Night shot mode or HDR. The battery holds up amazingly well. Even after a day of heavy usage, screen on over 8 hours I am able to end the day around 20-30% easily. I usually unplug around 6am and plug it back in around 10-11pm. Never do I feel like I need to top off the battery for fear of not making it through the day.

Everything else on the phone is still great, but not what I would consider a huge step up from previous models. Screen looks amazing, super bright in direct sunlight, Speakers are great, sometimes I forgo my Bluetooth speaker and just use the phones speakers. The matte glass back feels great, but most people won’t see it since most cover it up with a case to protect this investment. 

I would definitely recommend this to anyone, especially those already locked in to the Apple ecosystem. Apple’s iOS 13 is great, and offers some great features, but that isn’t specific to this phone so go and upgrade your old device first to see what you are getting here. I am very happy with my upgrade.",5,2019-10-20 14:20:00,"iphone11promax"
"2502",18,"Cost to value ratio is closing","I really like this iphone and iOS in general. However, what is up with iphone charging $1100 for 64gb vs Samsung Note 10+ offering 256gb in addition to an SD card option for the same price? Things like this are making me take pause about my decision to stay in the Apple ecosystem. I've had this phone a week and I still can't confirm in my mind if this makes sense, to keep my iphone simply because I want everything to work between my apple watch and my ipad. To make me question things even harder, i can get the Note 10+ with 256gb for $150 less than this iphone. Are the camera's that great that it's worth this price bump? These are the things that keep me up at night until my return period expires then I'm in for the next year at least. Never the less, this phone is pretty great so I'm rating it accordingly. No idea if I'm going to keep it or not yet, though.",4,2019-09-27 15:52:00,"iphone11promax"
"2503",19,"THE BATTERY! OH MY! THE CAMERA!","Okay, I'm hearing impaired. I heavily rely on video communication versus voice communication. So I easily drain my battery on my iPhone. But after upgrading to this, you have no idea how thrilled I am to have an iPhone that lasts me from the time I wake up until the time I go to sleep. The battery hasn't gotten low when going to bed. It's so great! When upgrading from iPhone X to iPhone XS Max, I was horrified by the front camera's beautify feature. I take a lot of selfies on X until XS Max, I never took selfie ever again. It was awful not seeing my face naturally because it looks like I'm wearing makeup or own a Samsung phone. However, upgrading to iPhone 11 Pro Max... I was so happy to see that the selfie camera is back to natural like photos. No, beautify garbage.",5,2020-01-14 04:17:00,"iphone11promax"
"2504",20,"Great phone!","This is my phone, and it offers significant advantages over our old 6s’s. First, facial recognition has been flawless not only for the phone, but for apps that accept it. It also is much easier to unlock and use (just look at the face of the phone) than finger print recognition. We also like the fact that we can get a charging pad for it, rather than having to plug and unplug a charging wire. The Apple wires are too short, and the longer 3rd-party ones do not hold up, in my experience, with constant use. The wide, normal, and telephoto lenses are a big improvement. The camera also is far more complex and versatile than the one I had on my 6s. I recommend going online for instructional info. The only thing I am still getting accustomed to is not taking screen-shots (pressing volume up button and on/off button simultaneously). I like the space gray.",5,2019-12-31 13:56:00,"iphone11promax"
"2505",21,"Amazing!!!!!","So I was content with my iPhone X for years and didn’t see much reason for an upgrade. After seeing what the iPhone 11 Pro Max had to offer I made not only a leap into a newer phone but also my first oversized phone. I love it!
the sound when watching Movies is very immersive completely blew me away for a smartphone!
I have yet to get into all the extra’s but what I have done in the new camera app running the new Tri Cam set up has been nothing short of amazing! Brilliant colors excellent clarity even the less talked about focused audio recording works great when filming your kids riding off on bikes just a little zoom and the sound and image is as if they never left your side. 
Battery life is impressive I forgot to charge over night and managed to make it through the next day of work. 
I have had nothing but fun enjoying my new iPhone Pro Max if you are considering making the switch I say go for it!!!


Ps my only complaint @apple I miss 3D Touch but I have got along without it as well it’s just so hard to say goodbye to yes......3D touch.",5,2019-09-29 22:08:00,"iphone11promax"
"2506",22,"Stellar phone","It really is a great phone! Best one yet.
Extremely durable, battery life is AMAZING, and 
Here are some things that I’ve noticed that aren’t necessarily bad, but might bother others:
- while the triple lenses are nice, picture quality still sucks. I will say that wide angle lens is awesome tho.
- night mode in the camera settings cannot stay permanently off. It’s great for light absorption in dark situations (similar to a long shutter speed on a dslr), but waiting 1-3 seconds for the picture to process is quite annoying. Especially when you either wanted a dark picture, or have subjects that can’t sit still. You can tap the night mode icon and slide the timer to off, but this must be done every time it detects inadequate light. 
- it’s heavy! Maybe because I came from the 8 & X, but still, for a phone, it’s quite the dense rock lol.
- the screen is “tall”; the Max models are larger In general, but compared to previous Plus models that had top & bottom caption-style hardware/home buttons, this one is pretty long compared to its lack of wideness. If you one-hand operate a lot, I’d recommend playing in many different apps to get a feel for how far you’ll have to stretch lol.
- the flashlight gives a pinkish hue.. unimportant I’m sure, but it’s also not as bright. 
Overall a great device and I would absolutely purchase again!",5,2019-11-01 16:19:00,"iphone11promax"
"2507",23,"This is a great phone!","I’ve been waiting to see whether I wanted to purchase the 11 pro max or wait for the new 12 to come out. I got the 11 pro max and I don’t regret it. It’s better than the iPhone X that I had because I missed the big screen and the ease of a bigger phone in my hands. I love the midnight green color as well. It’s much more different than the basic colors that have been available in the past. The cameras are ASTOUNDING!!!!!!!

I’m not going to tell you my exact location because then you’ll prolly wanna come and take selfies with MY amazingly awesome iPhone 11pro. Because it takes great selfies and while I consider myself rather dashing at times (I clean up well) I never really considered myself THAT photogenic. That is until this new iPhone.

My only issues is that I have to bring the control center down to see the battery percentage and the part that contains the face camera takes up a small portion of the screen.

There’s not really anything bad that I can say about it. The only negative to an $1,100 phone is that it doesn’t come with AirPods and it doesn’t have a USB-C charging port. I bought a wireless charging stand for at home and at work, so it doesn’t really matter a whole lot, but it would have been nice to have a only one charging port for all of my devices (iPhone, iPad, MacBook Pro, etc.)",5,2019-12-22 18:38:00,"iphone11promax"

Yet to use the camera but looking forward to it.",5,2020-01-24 15:16:00,"iphone11promax"
"2514",30,"Brilliant camera, lighting fast, and long battery!","You could not ask for a better combination. Downside Apple released the phone with the new IOS that contained a number of bugs.  To be fair they have already started releasing updates to fix those, but still expected a little more from Apple on a new IOS and phone release.
I got the Pro, while a family member also purchased the regular iPhone.  Both great phones, and really the biggest noticeable difference is the camera, which comes in handy for my job. Zooming in for photos or videos still provides crystal clear images.  I had a chance to the difference in pictures when we recently attended a concert.  With all the lighting effects, the iPhone 11 to good photos, but the Pro, lets just say that I was asked to send all my photos to my family member!",5,2019-10-26 09:54:00,"iphone11promax"
"2515",31,"Very happy","This was a must for my daughter,  she gets the newest phone every time  the phone is available for an upgraded as a Christmas gift.  Witch is every other year.  No headaches, no returns during the holidays, it’s a wonderful thing as well as the 11 PRO MAX is I think the best version so far.    I did this with all three kids and my youngest is 19 so you can imagine how many phones I’ve used and purchased.",5,2020-01-10 18:40:00,"iphone11promax"
"2516",32,"Top of the line phone won't disappoint","Purchased to have better camera. Camera is awesome and will be using it for video recording.

The face recognition is awesome. The finger scan unlock in the previous version I had didn't work when my fingers were wet. Amazing to not have to do anything but look at it.

The battery has been spectacular.",5,2020-02-03 07:06:00,"iphone11promax"
"2517",33,"Apple did it again","I love this phone, I’ve been iPhone user for years and years but the reason I gave 4 star is because the front camera sucks. iPhone 6,7 and 8 had better camera than 11pro and pro max. Overall phone is awesome.",4,2019-10-11 15:20:00,"iphone11promax"
"2518",34,"Great phone!","Take everything you thought was good about the last iPhone and make it a little bit better. That’s about it. Well actually, the camera Is quite a bit better!  Other than that, it’s just better all around n every measurable way. Should you buy this if you are currently using a 10s??  Depends on how important the camera is to you. Put it this way- if your on aTT next or whatever program your carrier offers, and your due for an upgrade, YES get it. If you have a xs and it’s paid off, I would say hold on. But if your paying 40 some odd dollars for the Xs every month and you Are due for an upgrade, might as well get the new one.  That’s just my opinion.",5,2019-10-18 19:16:00,"iphone11promax"
"2519",35,"The best iPhone so far","I have owned every iPhone release since iPhone 3GS, except for the iPhone 7 and 8 and the iPhone 11 Pro Max has every feature you would want from an iPhone from better battery life to amazing cameras. I upgraded from a iPhone 10s Max and even though the diferrences might seem small they are bigger than what it seems, that is not to say that the iPhone 10s Max was lagging in performance, it was still a good device. Each year Apple releases the best iPhone from thir previous iteration. If you want any of the missing features such as bilateral wireless charging, USB C, different design, then wait for the new iPhone in 2020 or go buy the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+, but if you love using iPhones then this is the one to get.",5,2019-09-28 08:45:00,"iphone11promax"
"2520",36,"So far it's a nice phone","I still had an iPhone 7s so it was time for an upgrade. I miss the home button but I'm slowly getting used to the ""swipe up"" feature. And the face recognition is nice. 
I don't do a lot with my phone so I haven't played with all the bells and whistles but it takes great pictures. 
Battery life is decent but not as great as I thought it should be.",5,2020-01-02 08:31:00,"iphone11promax"
"2521",37,"Great clarity and impressive speeds","I’ve always had great luck with iPhones. Love the features and design. However, I have had broken screens on the X and now a clear scratch on this new 11 pro max. For the screens to supposedly be so great, I haven’t had much luck.",5,2020-01-31 15:12:00,"iphone11promax"
"2522",38,"Big Improvement","Bought this as an upgrade from my iPhone 7 Plus. It was working OK but was out of on board storage. After owning it for less that two weeks I can say that the 11 Pro Max is better in every way. Screen colors, performance, camera, everything. Even the speakerphone is better. The cost was tough to swallow, but I'm very happy with the purchase so far.",5,2019-12-20 20:20:00,"iphone11promax"
"2523",39,"A Great update","While some might think the 3 camera setup is not the best design, the new phone is a great improvement.  I love the third lens and the setup.  I don't feel like I'm always getting my fingers in the way and I can see so much more in my photos.  Besides that the screen in the pro series is phenominal and an understated point …. I can easily see everything on the new display even in direct sunlight.  With the X and XS series I used to have to wonder because it wold be darker but this guy can keep up....  Besides all that I am loving the battery saving features of this phone it really is a large improvement with the A13 processor!",5,2019-09-28 06:08:00,"iphone11promax"
"2524",40,"Great Phone","I've switched between iPhone and Android often.  I'm really enjoying the 11 Pro Max.  For me personally, I like that it's heavier than past models and a little thicker.  The battery life has been great along with the cameras.    

If you have the X, XR, or XS it's not worth upgrading if you don't use the camera that often.  All of the improvements are great, but not worth upgrading just yet, in my opinion.",5,2019-09-23 16:50:00,"iphone11promax"
"2525",41,"Best Buy experience excellent!","We were focused on this phone, and based on previous experiences, decided Best Buy was our best plan. They had what we were looking for in inventory (could see on the website before going), and as always, were met and helped quickly and positively upon arrival. Great experience!",5,2020-01-10 16:22:00,"iphone11promax"
"2526",42,"A Much Needed Upgrade","My iPhone X was getting a little slow and glitchy. The 11 Pro is an amazing phone. I love the new frosted look and the new camera system is unbeatable. If you have the XS I would probably wait for the 2020 iPhone, but other than that I'd recommend the upgrade.",5,2019-10-05 10:36:00,"iphone11promax"
"2527",43,"Greatest iPhone Yet!","Most reviews I’ve read about the iPhone 11 Pro seem to lean towards it being nearly the same as the iPhone X. While the front may look the same, I’m here to tell you the internal components are where Apple invested their money on this newest version. The new A13 chip is incredibly snappy, the camera’s picture quality in low light settings is the best it’s ever been, and the battery life is outstanding. Yes, this wasn’t a dramatic visual overhaul of the iPhone, but Apple made significant improvements to the internal components and I am an extremely satisfied customer.",5,2019-09-27 19:31:00,"iphone11promax"
"2528",44,"Best yet!","The best iPhone yet! Has an awesome screen with the super retina XDR OLED display. It makes pictures and videos look amazing. The back glass is beautiful, it has the frosted glass look to it. Cameras are amazing and take the best pictures on any smartphone. Love the ultra wide camera. Very fast when performing tasks. With iOS you get updates very quickly and security is the best out there. Face ID is awesome and even faster now. This phone is amazing.",5,2019-10-29 13:06:00,"iphone11promax"
"2529",45,"GREAT iPhone","Glad I waited to get this model 11 Pro Max 256 GB so well worth the wait.. LOVING the 3 cameras!!! Love  the photos it takes plus it's a GREAT phone ... Plenty of storage space with the 256 GB easy to use and at last Apple improved battery life thank you Apple. Can go several days without a charge. Newest version of software works great NO issues.

"2530",46,"Unsurpassed elegance & superb performance","It is like holding a small high powered computer in the palm of your hand. Everything about the iPhone 11 Pro Max is perfect, except the price! The best feature I loved is the new 12MP triple camera system that allows you to take high quality ultra wide photos with ease. Bought this phone for my wife as a replacement for iPhone 8 Plus, and even though the 8 plus is slightly bigger than iPhone 11 Pro Max, the screen is about an inch larger in iPhone 11 Pro than 8 Plus. My wife absolutely loves it.",5,2019-10-04 18:41:00,"iphone11promax"
"2531",47,"iPhone lover.","I upgraded from the XS Max. It was well worth the upgrade for the amazing camera and battery life!  The camera is fantastic. It makes it so quick and easy to adjust for close up and wide angle pictures. The clarity is something else.

"2532",48,"Upgraded from a iPhone X","I tried the Note 10+ and I REALLY wanted to like that phone but ultimately I ended up returning it and waiting for the iPhone 11 Pro Max.  I just wanted a bigger phone and the iPhone just ticked all the boxes.  I'm not as invested in the Apple infrastructure as I once was but I still chose the iPhone over the Note for fit and finish, reliability and because I don't expect you to put bloatware from Game of Thrones or AT&T for a phone that I paid full price for.",5,2019-09-30 11:48:00,"iphone11promax"
"2533",49,"Amazing phone","I had originally purchased one of these for my mother, but liked it so much that I ended up getting it for both of my parents.

"2535",51,"Excellent battery life","I'm happy to have upgraded to this phone mostly because of the speed and battery life.  On a typical day, I still have over 75% battery at the end of the day.  On a day where I am constantly using text, browsers, phone calls, etc., it lasted the entire day without needing to be charged until I was ready to go to bed.  I'm still learning all the features of the phone, but I'm very happy with my purchase thus far.",5,2019-10-12 15:14:00,"iphone11promax"
"2536",52,"great phone, but not much change","i upgraded from the iPhone 10 so there really isn't too much of a change for me. the camera is a better quality than previous models as one would expect and the battery seems to last longer. If you have the 10 you may as well not upgrade and wait it out for next years iPhone release as it should have bigger changes/upgrades unless you're just looking to have the newest and latest as i did.",5,2019-10-17 17:58:00,"iphone11promax"
"2537",53,"AMAZING PHONE","Have to say,  I was hesitant going from my XS max to pro max thinking it would be about the same phone...

it is, however, the camera and software has been fixed from all my gripes and issues with my xs max 

Its making every photo app so much fun , the quality it produces is simply unreal

everything else from design to new screen/battery life improved also.",5,2019-10-24 23:12:00,"iphone11promax"
"2538",54,"iPhone 1 Prop MaxGreat item to keep up to date","Very good service, however it is difficult to learn it on your own,  Need some hands on education for such a complicated instrument.

"2539",55,"Love this phone!","I keep my phones for a long time.  So when my iPhone 6 died I looked forward to getting the new iPhone 11 Pro Max.  It’s night and day faster.  The last 2 days.  I charge it every other day.  Camera is great!",5,2019-10-26 14:10:00,"iphone11promax"
"2540",56,"Huge upgrade!","I went from a 6s to the best phone Apple has made to date. Obviously the camera quality is amazing. The night pics come out beautifully.

Feel like I can hang on to this phone for a long time.",5,2019-11-09 09:21:00,"iphone11promax"
"2541",57,"Love it","Only one thing I found to be a bother when your on speaker there’s feedback in to the other persons phone now the only thing I can think of it’s caused by the new battery using or the speaker wires are to close to it but hey Apple fix it please",5,2019-12-06 16:15:00,"iphone11promax"
"2542",58,"Another great apple product","This is my wife's phone. She loves it. The battery life has been great! On days during the work week, I honestly belive she could charge it every other day.

Good job Apple.",5,2019-11-02 10:22:00,"iphone11promax"
"2543",59,"I haven’t had an iPhone within 5 years.","Switched to iPhone because I like what they are doing with the software and a major plus for me is the battery life. Just from normal use, one charge will last me up to 48 hrs. That’s almost unheard of for a phone. As for the camera, it’s like having a DLSR camera in your pocket, almost that is. Build of the iPhone is great, rock solid, but it is on the heavy side for a phone, but it doesn’t bother me.",5,2019-09-27 15:29:00,"iphone11promax"
"2544",60,"Amazing upgrade on the camera","It takes beautiful pictures. My only complaint is that it is heavier than my previous phone the iPhone XS Max.  Right out of the box the 11 Pro Max is way heavier than the XS Max is in a case, and  once I put the pro max in a case it just felt so much heavier. I just put it in my backpack or hold it, it’s not really comfortable having it in your pocket",5,2019-10-18 15:55:00,"iphone11promax"
"2545",61,"Insane battery life and beautiful","The iPhone 11 Pro Max has the longest battery life I’ve ever experienced in a mobile device. I won give a breakdown as lifestyle and type of usage matters but I will have close  to 70% percent left after the full day. I have zero dead pixels and the HDR OLED screen is just gorgeous. No complaints so far except for AT&T and their backend issues connecting my iWatch to the phone but that’s another story",5,2019-09-27 15:21:00,"iphone11promax"
"2546",62,"Good but nothing too exciting","I recently upgraded from the iPhone 7 Plus but I don't find the new iPhone THAT exciting. I do like the facial recognition but I hate that I have to pick up my phone and face it directly at my face for it to work. And the camera are cool but nothing I couldn't do by zooming on my old phone...except the wide angle. I do like that. But this phone feels so much bigger in my hand so I am actually exchanging it for the 11 Pro instead of the 11 Pro Max.",4,2019-10-17 17:01:00,"iphone11promax"
"2547",63,"Love It!","Traded in my fairly new iPhone X 258 for this iPhone 11 Max Pro 512. It has the bigger screen like the 8+. The battery lasts abut 4 hours longer for me than my X, and the fast charger goes to 80% in about 330 minutes. Awesome. I haven’t used the cameras much, except for the wide-angle for landscapes and a few group selfies.

I was happy with the large screen and it worked great until fell into my pool a week before the new version was to be released. So what the heck, why not go for biggest and best.

"2551",67,"Great overall phone, camera is excellent","If upgrading from an iPhone 8 or earlier, the performance and enhanced camera and other capabilities are worth the price. From a later phone, your mileage may vary. The camera would be the main difference there. Phone feels good in the hand and seems like it is not a slippery. Slightly thicker but seems solid, Picture is very clear and phone speakers pack more volume. No complaints.",5,2019-09-27 16:32:00,"iphone11promax"
"2552",68,"Nice, but beware of learning curve","The display is a lot better than my old 6S Plus. However I cannot find a case I like in the color I like unless I bought the 11.  It is pretty much the same size and feel as the 6S Plus, so no changes in fitting my inside coat pocket. The only big problem I had was that the tech at my local Best Buy inserted my old sim card instead of the new one.

It is a good phone, but it freezes on me multiple times of the day. It also does not like doing multiple things at once. Take for instance when I have my phone connect to Apple car play and using WAYS I can only have 25 - 30 minute phone calls. A lot of the time it refuses to maintain a connection after that and I have to call them back after it hangs up. If it stays on for longer then WAYS stops working and turns itself off. This sucks for me because I’m always on the road. It also likes to disconnect from Bluetooth while I’m in the car (While not plugged into anything) during a call and I have to either try to connect it back to my car or restart my phone. Really that’s all I’ve really had to deal with since I purchased the phone. When it works properly it’s a great phone, but that is rare.",3,2019-12-03 11:56:00,"iphone11promax"

It did not turn on???? I brought it home and found the left side of phone was open I new it would be very hard to explain so I didn’t don’t like to blame someone for something I can’t prove!

First, facial recognition has been flawless not only for the phone, but for apps that accept it. It also is much easier to unlock and use (just look at the face of the phone) than finger print recognition. We also like the fact that we can get a charging pad for it, rather than having to plug and unplug a charging wire. The Apple wires are too short, and the longer 3rd-party ones do not hold up with constant use. The gold color also is quite striking.",5,2019-12-31 13:21:00,"iphone11promax"

"3490",10,"Great Phone that scratches easily","I love the phone, especially the camera. After upgrading from a 7 Plus, I got used to the new gestures and lack of home button very quickly. The only negative I have is that, after having several iPhones and never using a screen protector, after less than 2 weeks, my screen has a scratch deep enough for me to feel with my fingernail. I have no idea how it happened because I've treated it the same as all other non-scratched phones. It's bothering me to see so I guess I'll have to put a screen protector on it. Maybe it'll hide the scratch. There is a discussion about it on the Apple page as well. I recommend the phone, just go ahead and put a screen protector on it from the start.",5,2019-10-25 21:44:00,"iphone11promax"
"3491",11,"Awesome phone.","It’s been seven days with it and can say that it is a great iPhone 
I come from an iPhone XR that i had for barely 4months, it’s crazy!
Prior to that i had an iPhone 6 for 5 years and an iPhone 4s for 4 years, so am not exactly a compulsive iPhone buyer hehe, The only reason that I switch my XR for the 11 Pro was the camera AND because i had the chance to get a good deal on it, but the iOS its great too. i was one of the lucky ones that didn’t get pesky bugs with it. I don’t know how to really describe it all i can tell that so far this is an awesome phone. The pictures it takes look professional, videos and games vey crisp, of course everything else is good too, calls, Bluetooth connectivity with my devices is great no drops, Siri is more intelligent now.so much that am actually using it. Am just a happy iPhone owner the kind of happiness that only iPhone owners know, if you have a chance to upgrade don’t hesitate, you wont regret it.",5,2019-09-27 18:08:00,"iphone11promax"
"3492",12,"Great for people who love taking photos!","I know this is said every year but this is truly the best iPhone camera Apple has ever made! In addition to that, the battery is incredible. I can go a whole day without needing to worry about charging it. If you’re fan of gaming on the go, the new selection of games on Apple Arcade look absolutely beautiful on this giant screen. With the new processor, some of these games can almost stand up with console games in terms of graphics and quality. And lastly, the phone itself is absolutely beautiful to look at and hold. The three cameras took some getting used to at first but now they look great imo.",5,2019-10-19 11:55:00,"iphone11promax"
"3493",13,"Amazing camera!","Decided to upgrade from iPhone X. Amazing quality only Apple provides. Longer battery life, unbelievably fast, and pictures are amazing!

I’m a heavy user but during this time I kept it basic normal lighting, texting was over the top and I’d say social media 6 hours  off and on. My battery went down to 10%.

All my devices bought on the last 10 years are still working and I can’t imagine bring them to recycling, so I believe that I’m a few years I will have a persona museum to show to the new generations of my relatives part of the tech history!!!

They look identical except for the camera, but it really is a big improvement in battery life, screen, picture quality and function. Quality feel and look is excellent.   I do hope it is not plagued with battery issues as so many modern day iPhones tend to have.   Its expensive !",5,2019-10-02 00:46:00,"iphone11promax"

It’s easy to see easy to read I have a small hand it’s not too big or too or falling out of my hand I do have a silicone case so in case it does fall it won’t break.

It works well in low light, or night photography because of which it gets an edge over other phones. The images that this device is able to capture with little light is amazing. The battery holds up amazingly well. Even after a day of heavy usage, the screen on over 10 hours, I am able to end the day around 20-30% easily.

"3763",283,"The best iPhone ever","I’ve had the iPhone 11 Pro Max for a little over a month now. I can say that this is hands down the best iPhone ever. It is very expensive yes, and it does what most other iPhones can do but this phone does it all so quick and smoothly. Every app loads up quick, and the battery life is outstanding. I take my phone off the charger at about 1pm and head out at 3pm. By the time I get home at around 1am I still have 50 to 60% battery life left. I use my phone quite a bit throughout the day to play Pokémon go lol and watch YouTube / browse the web and social media. 
The camera is also remarkable, especially when shooting video. It takes the best video I’ve seen on a smartphone, I always shoot at 4K 60fps and it’s crisp and pretty. Especially in low light / concerts. The screen on this iPhone is very bright and colors pop nicely. It’s my favorite smartphone ever. I know this phone is very expensive, but If you’re a “power user” and want a great camera on your phone, then I think it’s worth the money. Skip the base model and get at least 256gb though. You’ll quickly eat up storage if you take a lot of video.",5,2019-11-26 22:35:00,"iphone11promax"

While it looks extremely similar to the last gen iPhone it’s so much more.  The cameras are phenomenal, better than my galaxy by far in pictures and video.  The speed and smoothness of IOS is unrivaled by any operating system I have tried.  Oh and the battery... I can’t believe this is an iPhone, I’m a very heavy user and can make it all day easily without having to worry about having a charger near by.  I was highly impressed with the S10+ battery, the iPhone exceeds what it could do.  I’m not thrilled about the price, but if you’re here you already the iPhone is very expensive.

Dylan Seibel was a great help if I may add. He knew all the ins and outs and details to get me the best deal on a trade in / port to Verizon.

Got $450 for my iPhone 8 Plus. Got a $200 MasterCard gift card, and free Unlimited Apple Music for the term of my contract.

Do auto-pay and get another $10 off. Veteran? Get another $15 off monthly.

Can’t beat it.

Oh. And that camera on this model is: Wow. I posted some sample pics I took. Battery: Another wow. Love the OLED super bright screen, too. If you’re on the fence, jump over it. You won’t regret buying the IPhone 11 Pro Max.

"3922",15,"Fantastic upgrade that is surprisingly worth it","Coming from an iPhone XS Max, I didn’t to be wowed by the iPhone 11 Pro Max. But after using it for a couple of weeks, I have really appreciated the improvements that have been made. The battery life is the best I’ve seen in an iPhone. I’m getting whole day battery life with the screen brightness at 1/5 the bar, a big improvement to the XS Max which I kept the brightness lower. The cameras are also greatly improved, which the ultra wide lense and Night Mode have made taking pictures more fun and satisfying. The front camera finally brings a wider camera making group pictures much easier to frame. The loss of 3D Touch is unfortunate as I really enjoyed using it in different ways, but I would rather sacrifice it if it means we continue to have much larger batteries going forward. The other differences such as the newer processor aren’t really noticeable but are likely important for more strenuous tasks and device longevity. Finally, the midnight green color is great.

Honestly I don’t think everyone should upgrade to this iPhone if their current iPhone is working fine. I upgraded because I lack self control and like having the latest, greatest iPhone. But if you are moving from a 8 or older, you’re in for a treat.",5,2019-09-29 22:50:00,"iphone11promax"
"3923",16,"Battery Life and Camera’s are top notch!","I jump back from Android and iPhone fairly often. I feel confident that iPhone 11 Pro Max is sticking around for a while. The battery life is amazing! It’s one thing to hear about it, but another to see it in action! The battery lasts all day and that’s with me checking Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter pretty often along with using FaceTime and YouTube. I only need to charge when going to bed, but if I needed to charge because I’m heading somewhere the fast charging is super fast. Coming from a Pixel 3XL I’m no stranger to fast charge, but this seems much faster. 
Oh and the Camera’s. They are so great! I was apprehensive about leaving my Pixel’s camera behind especially with family moments and young kids, but the iPhone camera is really amazing. And the night shot feature is really good as well! 
The phone itself is iPhone. iOS, icons, notch, etc. none of those things are negatives for me, but consider that too when choosing between camps. 
Oh 1 more thing... the sound!! So loud and very good with the 3D feeling of the sound. It’s all software I’m assuming, but those speakers had me turning left and right even when watching a YouTube video! Great speakers! I thought I would miss forward facing speakers on my Pixel, but these are so good and loud!",5,2019-09-27 16:02:00,"iphone11promax"
"3924",17,"Very happy with this phone.","I upgraded from an XR and can say this phone was a nice upgrade over that model and really enjoy using this phone.

The screen looks nice and pictures are awesome, but the real story here is the battery life. While the XR had great battery life the 11 Pro Max has phenomenal battery life. Apple has always done a great job  with standby battery usage, but the battery would drop quickly with heavier usage. The XR was better, but this Pro Max does not have that issue at all. I believe it is a combination of the larger battery and A13 chip efficiency. Consumer reports is reporting 40 hours of simulated user usage with the Pro Max versus 29 hours with the XS Max. 

This was an upgrade I was on the fence about, and honestly did it so I could pass the XR to my son. I had planned to wait until next year. 5G is not a big deal for me and my son needs a phone now. I also needed the 2x zoom on the camera. I like the 11 Pro Max has the lightning connector also since I have other devices that have the same connection. I can say the battery life and camera made the upgrade worth it. I am also glad I sprung for the 512 GB version because I am going to keep this phone for a while.",5,2019-10-05 03:18:00,"iphone11promax"
"3925",18,"Another Great Release","I’ll admit that I remain an Apple fan due to everything working well together and for it just fits my needs. This new one is definitely faster and new iOS makes it more intuitive. Camera is definitely better than the already good on in the XS Max and battery life is definitely better. Holds up after heavy use all day so far. If you want better battery life and camera upgrades this is headed in the right direction. iPhone XSMax pictures are amazing and who wouldn’t want longer battery without having to use battery packs.",5,2019-09-23 00:33:00,"iphone11promax"

This isnt a bad thing honestly. Instead of striving for innovation they strive for perfection. The iphone is sleek, clean, and easy to use where as android is complex and customizable. When looking to purchase this phone I would base off what you currently have and what youre looking for. Iphone is very surface level and android lets you dive deep. At this point in the phone game it falls to preference. Both are great but I prefer iPhone and the apple ecosystem.",5,2019-12-26 16:03:00,"iphone11promax"
"3927",20,"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I originally wanted the Midnight Green but they sold out, so settled for the Space Gray, and I love it, my iPhone 10 Max was Space Gray as well. The battery life on this is the truth, I can literally get a entire day out it, and that’s including watching videos, playing games, and Surfing the web and social media, and Apple including the 18watt battery charger which is THE TRUTH meaning it WORKS I was like 13% late one night I plugged in the 18 watt charger And went from 13% to like 35% in like 15 minutes , IOS 13.1",5,2019-09-27 16:48:00,"iphone11promax"
"3928",21,"Superior Customer Service","The phone is amazing, as normal with Apple, but this post is more about my experience than the product. Best Buy sent me a great offer to trade in my iPhone X to get direct credit towards the purchase of an 11 Pro if I preordered. They gave me a great offer for my trade in, so I went ahead and accepted the offer. When I went to pick up my new phone, it refused to activate, and ended up being a system issue on. Verizon’s side. To make a long story short, I was in the store for about 5 hours while the mobile team did everything in their power to try and resolve the issue, but they were unable to. We ended up having to cancel the order and reorder a different phone. The perseverance and customer service that everyone from the mobile team showed me was AMAZING, and despite the frustration with the activation issue, I am even more loyal to Best Buy because of their hard work and great attitudes.

You can see the deeper contrast in the screen compared to the X, and XS. The cameras are amazing and the battery life is GREAT! depending on your use, I’ve been able to go two days without charging. The speed and smooth operation of the phone is what can be expected with a new iPhone and A13 chip. If you have an older plus model or even the X or XS I would definitely upgrade if you can afford it. Reception is also better than the XS Max.",5,2019-10-05 23:08:00,"iphone11promax"

The phone I wanted, in Space Gray, was not in stock at the Best Buy store and had to be mailed to me.  It turned out the the Verizon SIM card that was included could not be recognized.  A Best Buy Support rep tried to help me and was unsuccessful.  I have to go to my local Verizon store to get help with the problem.  Turns out they only had to swap the SIM from my current phone to the new iPhone and subsequently everything went well with the setup.  Then came the next issue when I found that I couldn't make calls and would get a Verizon error message that the account was not active.  Fortunately a quick call to Verizon had this problem resolved.  I don't know why the Verizon support rep didn't think to check on that.",5,2019-10-05 13:13:00,"iphone11promax"

I am very please so far it has only been a week using my iPhone 11 pro max. I am still trying to navigate using this iPhone. It takes some getting use too not having an actual back button and the actual vibrate option. That is the reason for my rating of average on the ease of use.

"3934",27,"Nice upgrade for 8+ and x users","I have an XR on my business phone and would say that this is a small upgrade from last years phones unless you are a camera person. So upgrading from a XS,XSM, or XR is less likely that you will see huge improvement or need to upgrade. The one big difference I saw from my iPhone X is the battery life on the pro max is fantastic. I pull my phone off the charger before going to bed and I can still get through a whole day work day and not needing a charge until around 9-10pm. I would consider myself a power user as throughout the day I have emails, spreadsheets, and YouTube streaming in the background for 4-5 hours amongst other items. The cameras are a big improvement and really close the short fall they had in low light photography. The iPhone went from not competing in low light to trading blows with what is considered the best camera on a smartphone the google pixel. I can honestly say I’m not regretting my purchase and if you have a iPhone X or later the small improvements will make you happy with your purchase.",4,2019-10-04 22:23:00,"iphone11promax"

I've been wanting that feature for a while and comes in handy when you just can't backup any further due to obstructions. As for the other two lenses and the overall camera quality, it's fantastic.

I own other phones as well. Android is great, but if stability in updates is what you want, and you want the updates to keep coming - you can't beat Apple.

Remember this - Apple produces the OS and the iPhone. The two are mated together and maintained to high standards.",5,2019-11-15 17:13:00,"iphone11promax"

The screen has better resolution, the camera is great (for a phone).  One of the main things I like about the new phone is that it’s the size of my old iPhone 8 Plus but with a larger screen that’s sharper.  I have also noticed this phone is a tad quicker to load apps with the new processor.

One thing that I thought was going to be a problem for me is the lack of the home button on my other iPhones, but I was able to adjust after a day of using the phone.  Also the Face ID feature is a cool update and I have adjusted to this.

I would recommend this phone, just wish apple would calm down with the prices!",5,2019-10-20 19:34:00,"iphone11promax"

From the OS to the fast charge and yes even the obvious. The three cameras on the back which for me (a loyal phone photographer) is my favorite feature and update.

For most of my previous iPhones I purchased a battery case because they didn’t quite make it through the day but that won’t be necessary with this one.

The triple lens camera with night mode, 4K video are amazing, and of course the speed is sweet. The updated Face ID has been I joy. You can lie it down and it reads your Face ID smoothly.  The missing items was reverse charging and 5G, but the 5G is still new maybe by 2021 it will be more mainstream.",5,2019-10-26 00:34:00,"iphone11promax"
"3960",53,"good but I like my iphone X better","it is a good cell phone but if you need to upgrade from iPhone X ?
I don't know. I still did not find anything really better than iPhone X. I guess it is just the way apple make their business. every year new generation iPhone and people spend money to get the newest one",4,2019-12-20 16:51:00,"iphone11promax"
"3961",54,"Great overall phone","I switched from Samsung to Apple.  I loved my Samsung but find the iPhone to be more intuitive.  I haven’t used the camera feature yet but am going to travel soon and am looking forward to using it.",5,2019-12-28 08:16:00,"iphone11promax"
"3962",55,"Great simple upgrade over iPhone XS Max","Great simple upgrade over iPhone XS Max, really happy that they finally listened to consumers, and increased battery life at the expense of thickness and weight. Great choice imo",5,2020-01-04 15:31:00,"iphone11promax"
"3963",56,"I expected more","iPhones are great, don’t get me wrong. The battery life on this phone is phenomenal and the camera is pretty awesome too, but, it has some downfalls. The day after I purchased the phone my notification sounds were glitchy a few times which was odd to me. I’ve never had that happen before with any other model and I’ve had almost every one. Just today my phone froze and shut off which, also, never happened before. I’m not sure if i just got a wonky one or what. I’m an iPhone lover and I have to have the latest one but I’m a little disappointed with this release. It’s very similar to the last phone.",4,2019-11-02 02:55:00,"iphone11promax"
"3964",57,"Fancy. I had a 6S and this is a major improvement","This phone is bigger in every way. Sound, feel, weight, power, battery life. Great stuff. I will coddle it for another several years as I did with the one I had. I wiped the other one and will use as a big iPod for the car/house.",5,2019-12-10 17:11:00,"iphone11promax"
"3965",58,"Phone that is at first a phone","If you want a phone that you can access voicemail, depend on applications not crashing and have the fastest phone tested to be faster than even the new Snapdragon 855 chipsets, this is the phone. It will not overheat, it will not crash and you get your phone and voicemail with some sense of privacy. Nothing new here, if you have one already though you only get a better camera.",5,2019-10-04 20:11:00,"iphone11promax"
"3966",59,"Best iPhone ever","I’ve been buying iPhones since the 3G model back in 2008. If you are a fan of iOS or Apple products in general this one doesn’t disappoint. I moved from an iPhone X to this one and feel it is worth the upgrade. The camera is excellent, the OLED screen is fantastic. Watching HDR video is like watching one of the LG OLED 4K TVs.",5,2019-10-25 16:25:00,"iphone11promax"
"3967",60,"Amazing new iPhone","Absolutely love the distinctive new design and the new cameras! Battery life is also significantly better compared to the iPhone XS max. Overall a great upgrade.

"3969",62,"Great Camera","The updates on the camera make me feel, and the end product look, like the pictures are taken professionally.  The portrait option has just gotten better and gets better with every upgrade in IOS.  It’s an Apple product so I wouldn’t expect anything but the best, especially for the price that is paid, but it is worth every penny.",5,2019-10-18 23:45:00,"iphone11promax"

"3972",65,"Best iPhone yet!!!","I decided to get a new phone on release day, and I am so happy!  The phone itself has great battery life, a wonderful screen and the camera is just unbelievable.  The camera is so good that I now regret lugging around an expensive mirrorless rig.  I took a shot of a sunset that blows people away, especially when I tell them it’s from my iPhone.",5,2019-10-11 19:39:00,"iphone11promax"
"3973",66,"Super","I love the new iphone 11 pro max. The picture quality is amazing. Night shots look as if they were taken in daytime. Everything is super clear on it. I thought the iphone X was pretty good until I got the chance to see the difference the 11 makes. There is a learning curve with the 11. It's not cheap but the trade-in made it more affordable.",5,2019-10-12 02:10:00,"iphone11promax"
"3974",67,"very fast","first time I have a Max or big iPhone, I was more incline to the small phones specially since I carry them in my pockets and run with it...

"3976",69,"Amazing Phone","Amazing phone but I will never buy another phone online from Best Buy. Finally got the phone to work today after calling Verizon and waiting on hold 40 min. All the iPhone 11s Best Buy had we’re set for the wrong Activation date 5 days later. I love Best Buy but this was a terrible Experience. Had I traded in my phone I would not have had a working phone for days!!!!",5,2019-09-27 18:13:00,"iphone11promax"
"3977",70,"Bought the first day","I had been waiting anxiously for this release.  I bought it the first day at Best Buy. No wait and no line.  It has met my expectations so far.",5,2019-09-28 15:25:00,"iphone11promax"
"3978",71,"If you need a larger screen this is it","I wanted a larger phone and have been using apple devices for a while.  It's heavier than the older, smaller phones but if you know IOS there is not much else to say.  The new cameras take excellent pictures and video.  It's too soon to comment on battery life, but like the other phones I've had this is a solid device.",5,2019-10-17 16:48:00,"iphone11promax"
"3979",72,"Another amazing device from Apple","Upgraded from the X Max and don’t regret it one bit! The camera is unlike any camera that has graced the iPhone. Battery life is definitely an improvement from last years model (my biggest reason for wanting to upgrade). Love the midnight green coloring. Like always, apple has created a gorgeous device that works seamlessly with the IOS software.",5,2019-10-04 16:50:00,"iphone11promax"
"3980",73,"Great new features","My husband was having problems with his IPhone 6 keeping a charge. But new batteries would not get him new features and a better camera .

"3981",74,"Do not regret this purchase","Really cannot speak highly enough about this phone. Finally switched over from years of Android OS phones. Everything, from the watch and the AirPods, works so flawlessly with one another comparative to Android based systems. Not quite as customizable as Android, but it’s worth the sacrifice, in my opinion.",5,2019-10-18 15:53:00,"iphone11promax"
"3982",75,"Excellent upgrade","Camera is fantastic really leaving little to no need for a dslr camera.  Phone is big but manageable.  iOS 13 has some upgrades that are advantageous such as night shots.  Overall the price is high and not necessarily worth spending that much each year but last phone was iPhone 6S+ so this is an excellent upgrade.",5,2019-10-13 10:17:00,"iphone11promax"
"3983",76,"Very Beautiful Phone","At first when I saw all the photos of the phone online, I feared that I wouldn’t like the design. But when you get the phone and look at it in person it’s beautiful. Other than a few iOS 13 glitches, the phone overall is wonderful. The camera is as amazing as advertised. If you have an older iPhone and you’re looking to upgrade, this phone is a good choice.",5,2019-09-22 12:13:00,"iphone11promax"
"3984",77,"A week in, it's performing as advertised.","A week in, the pricey device is performing as advertised--fast, crisp graphics, and even a slowfie / slofie shot taken for kicks and giggles turned out like I gather a slowfie / slofie should.  Still getting used to Face ID (not a fingerprint) opening up apps and saving passwords, but I'm optimistic that'll become second nature soon enough.",5,2019-09-28 07:48:00,"iphone11promax"
"3985",78,"Great phone","I wasn’t planning on getting a new phone but was impressive with the oled screen. I’m not a fan of the bigger phones so I preferred the max. Don’t waste your money on 64gb.

"3986",79,"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Let me say I, along with my family, are Apple people. With 4 iPhones, 3 MacBook Pros, three iPads, and an Airport Time Capsule, we like Apple. As for the newest iPhone 11 Pro, not so good. The screen and camera are great, when they work correctly. IOS 13 has been plagued with issues since receiving the phone. I’m sure Apple is active in correcting the issues, but personally I believe they released it too soon. Due to the issues I’ve had, sadly I can’t recommend it as of yet. Any phone is only as good as it’s operating system, which sadly hasn’t been that great...",4,2019-10-18 15:53:00,"iphone11promax"

The man at the Apple store just recommended that I not even use one since the glass is so strong.The only reason for four stars instead of five is the cost is somewhat ridiculous.

"4013",106,"Really it's just another iphone","I read these reviews and see a very common theme in what's been left forbothers to read, "" great upgrade"", "" love the new features especially the camera"". Let's be really honest here it's the exact same phone that has came out over the last 3 years, pretty much since the ""limited edition"" iPhone x, which ended up not being limited at all and became the current apple standard. It's what to expect from apple, luxury build quality great display, Thanks Samsung!! Or LG for the cheaper models. The only difference really is the cameras which is only catching up to what the Google pixel kicked off with the low light phenomena bringing crystal clear pics in the darkest settings apple of course dumps every high end part available right down to the screws I'm sure are dipped in unicorn sweat just because why not as for a great upgrade not really at all if you bought a iPhone in the last 2 years save your money your not missing anything at all except the capability not to upgrade to iOS 13, there some pretty major flaws and privacy concerns surrounding this build so if your one of the smart ones who hasn't upgrade I would continue not to if I where you at least for a few months when all the security issues are patched that being said in display touch id, 5g and sure to be revolutionary camera upgrades are all to come in the iPhone 12 and from what I've heard and read there's some really exciting groundbreaking and a complete build overhaul coming so if coming from say iPhone 8 then this is for you iPhone X and up hang on to your cash after all this will be obsolete in 6 months by apples standards at least hold off for the next round because 1500 dollars plus for a couple camera upgrades and USB C charging finally is not worth the cost of a decent car",3,2019-10-04 23:20:00,"iphone11promax"

I upgraded from an iPhone 6 Plus and find the face recognition along with a bigger screen to be a great feature. Apple made it super easy/seamless to migrate from my iPhone 6, everything transferred wirelessly. I'm also loving the swipe keys feature and all the other new updates now that iOS 13 is stable.

The OLED screen is so brilliant. I have watched Youtube and movies I have in 4K on the phone. They look terrific and the ohone has Dolby Atmos sound. Great experience!

I also love the size. It is almost too big for my pockets, but I don't care because the size is perfect for using the phone, and there is more space to see the images and videos and websites on the phone.

While using the speaker, or Bluetooth in the car, the sound is like an echo with airplane noises. I’ve tried everything and the only thing that helps is to turn the volume down very low but then I can’t hear my caller. The camera utilizes widescreen on the back camera so while FaceTiming, the other person sees distortion of plus Yiu can see pixels as you move the phone around. Lastly, it took five hours to get service at the store. It took a Samsung expert to help the manager by suggesting to swap out the new SIMS card, which was defective. Unless you get this phone on sale, which I did, I would wait to see if the microphone and widescreen distortion gets fixed.

"4608",701,"Outstanding","I upgraded from an iPhone 8+. This phone surpasses it in every way. Better screen, much better battery life, and better camera. Face ID works well and it was easy to adjust to no home button. Really like the phone.",5,2019-12-21 04:29:00,"iphone11promax"
"4609",702,"Great camera and battery life","I would recommend this phone just for the battery life upgrade. I had an iPhone 7plus and battery life was only a couple of hours. I love the new screen and quick access to my apps.",5,2020-01-04 14:27:00,"iphone11promax"
"4610",703,"I’m glad I stuck with Apple","I’m glad I stuck with Apple. I was pondering between the pixel four and the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max. Looks like pixel four is a bust even though it takes good pictures. I’m glad I stuck with apple seems to be a very solid phone great speed it looks Keep growing on me.",5,2019-11-15 16:53:00,"iphone11promax"
"4611",704,"Great phone","Phone is good and pictures are awesome.  One down side is not having a home button.  I have an iphone for a long time and they have always had the home button.  I find my self trying to click on the home button, that's no longer there.  Opening the phone and closing open programs are all done by sliding up.  Iphone 11 is a big learning curve from the iphone 8 plus.  I do like all the features that are available with the camera.",4,2019-12-03 19:25:00,"iphone11promax"
"4612",705,"If you want a good Smartphone go Android","I've had this phone for just over a month so I feel like I've had enough time to really give a fair judgement: The phone is fine. It's a good smartphone and does what a smartphone is intended. 

But my god does this phone feel like such a drag after using android and pixel. 

The camera quality on my two year old pixel is way better than this new iphone and it was able to do more. This iphone camera feels very limiting. The pictures are sub-par quality. They're fine if you take casual photos but if you're trying to take something nice then forget it. 

It had trouble with wifi no matter where I'm at. In fact it seems like Wifi only slows it down! I had the same issue the last time I had an iphone so at this point I think it's an apple problem. 

I could go on but there is just almost no quality in this phone where an android or pixel isn't better. 

And then the price is ridiculous! You pay more for a phone that's just okay. 

If you want to get your money's worth then go for the samsung galaxy or google pixel. Not only are they usually cheaper but they are loads better and can do more. At this point iphone is more of a fashion accessory or status symbol.",3,2019-11-27 08:49:00,"iphone11promax"
"4613",706,"Love it!","Size is great. Camera awesome!  Midnight Green looks more like gray. Color is not vibrant but the user does not look at the back much anyway. So fast, easy to find what I need. Keeps charge so well!",5,2019-11-16 08:14:00,"iphone11promax"

"4626",719,"Huge Upgrade","I didn’t realize how much of the scene was missing from my pictures until I started using the ultra wide camera lens. It should come standard on all flagships! The camera system is absolutely amazing. I am really impressed with Night Mode. The OLED display is stunning, and I love Dark Mode in iOS 13! I thought I would miss Burst Mode, but I think I like taking Slofies more. I also like the added ability to adjust settings within Apple’s Camera app. Despite all the complaints about iOS 13, I have had very few problems, much less than I did with any of the Android smartphones I had a few years ago. The only major thing I don’t like about iPhones is the high price.",5,2020-01-01 13:24:00,"iphone11promax"

I love the size of my 11 Pro Max, the quality of the camera, the speaker phone works great and I dearly love the 512 GB storage and the large size of the screen!  I don’t miss touching the button at the bottom, you just swipe upwards on the line (same thing!).  
When Best Buy had this phone on sale for a Christmas sale, I ordered it immediately!  Verizon sale was buy one/get one (a lesser phone), but I did not need 2 phones/2 lines and the 1st phone was full price.  Best Buy was there for me again!!",5,2020-01-04 04:14:00,"iphone11promax"
"4629",722,"The best phone on the market.","Absolutely incredible phone. This really seems like the greatest upgrade Apple has ever done on an iPhone compared to its predecessor.

Reads your face at almost any angle.",5,2019-12-21 10:02:00,"iphone11promax"
"4633",726,"Decent Upgrade","I wasn’t looking to upgrade but family member wanted to buy my Xs Max from me so sold it and bought the 11 Pro Max.  Biggest improvement for me is the battery.  I’ve used it for the last two days without a charge and I still have 56%.  The screen is also a decent improvement with better whites, blacks and brightness.  As for the camera, I guess if you take a lot of pictures then it’s worth an upgrade but if your like me who uses it more for work...I wouldn’t upgrade.  The three lenses on the back make it look weird and prefers the previous two lenses.",4,2020-01-03 15:52:00,"iphone11promax"

"4663",756,"BB Customer Service was great about screen issue!","I'm a huge fan of Apple products, and a long-time owner of a succession of iPhones.  A lot more expensive than other brands, but the quality has always been worth it.  The durability has allowed me to ""live life"" without worrying about breakage resulting from normal, everyday use.  

I'm always very mindful of how I handle my electronics, and NEVER careless; vigilant but not paranoid.  Do I toss it in my pocketbook?  Of course!  Do I put it in the back pocket of my jeans once in a while?  Who doesn't?   

With no change in my day-to-day use, in 4 days, the screen of this ""11"" had a couple of fractures!  It was not dropped, and nothing hit it; nor did anything scratch or gouge it.  I immediately went back to BB to discuss the issue, and it was resolved with an exchange and the recommendation of a tempered glass screen protector.  I did get the screen protector for the replacement iPhone, and it's a good thing I did...  I’ve already had to replace that, yesterday, for the same problem:  unexplained fracture.  (This time the iPhone screen ""survived."")

Apparently this model is the first one that can't be popped in my back pocket for a few minutes to free up my hands.  I believe it's a design flaw and I'll be watching to see if this is noted as a common occurrence.  While I love everything else about it, this would be one concern in ""recommending"" it.

"4693",786,"Great Camera and Display","The new iPhone has a great new camera and crisp, clear display. Otherwise, it’s not much different from the iPhone 7 I had before it. Also, having the 64 GB memory space as the introductory level kind of sucked.",4,2019-11-08 16:14:00,"iphone11promax"

I have the 256 GB  and I don’t think I will ever run out of room. There is so many features on this phone if I keep it for 10 years I will probably find something new.

I am amazed at  how long the the battery last I can leave it on and use it for 3 days before I have to charge it",5,2019-12-06 15:56:00,"iphone11promax"

"4703",796,"Impressive!!!","I recently upgraded from the iPhone 7 Plus to the iPhone 11 Pro Max and I couldn’t be happier with my purchase. I was really excited to test out the new camera and it doesn’t disappoint. From how it shoots in low light areas to the 3 different lens types. I’m still getting a feel for the phone overall, but so far so good. My only gripe so far would be the lack of colors the phone actually comes in.",5,2020-01-04 21:32:00,"iphone11promax"
"4704",797,"Up grade","I had to upgrade from my 6splus. The charging port finally broke... the lint in the port just ruined it. This phone is exact size to my previous phone. It does take a bit of getting use to; no home button, screen shots are the volume and lock button, ect. A nice upgrade! The camera is AWESOME and the biometrics are better the the finger print.",5,2020-01-17 17:08:00,"iphone11promax"
"4705",798,"Great IPhone favorite so far","My last IPhone was a 7 plus(my previous favorite) this phone has great camera, no major improvements with SIRI, it’s extremely fast especially with the facial recognition. At first I missed the home button, but after using raise to wake and facial recognition, no problem. The battery life is the best feature, I’m using it for work and personal, (2) separate emails, Twitter, Instagram and Safari use as well as location services on. After 1st complete charge, 16 hours, and wasn’t dead!!!",5,2019-12-06 15:35:00,"iphone11promax"

"4707",800,"Nice phone with great features","This phone is an upgrade from the 6s, so there are some major improvements and enhancements. Really like the camera, facial recognition and the fact that I can take advantage of the latest iOS release. Bought a protective case and screen protector so am enjoying the upgraded phone with features.
We did have to upgrade several apps and the iOS after purchasing the phone, but only experienced some minor problems with that.",5,2019-12-14 18:54:00,"iphone11promax"
"4708",801,"Awesome!","An iPhone 8+ was my first ever iPhone, and upgrading to this seemed daunting. I love it, though, and I feel I am able to get every penny's worth out of it. The quality of this device is incredible abd the camera is totally worth it. The staff was happy to help me set it up. I would recommend this to anyone!",5,2020-01-15 17:09:00,"iphone11promax"
"4709",802,"Love this phone","It takes a lot to get used to not having a home button and I am still working on getting the swipes down but I love the phone and the cameras.

First time I had a phone newer than my grands so I am learning it all on my own.",5,2019-12-28 17:09:00,"iphone11promax"
"4710",803,"Love my iPhone 11 ProMax","Yes, they are pricey but you get what you pay for.  The screen is huge.  I'm a senior and that alone makes it excellent for me.  I traded in an iPhone 7 Plus for this phone and that screen was big but now that the viewing screen expands the width of the phone really makes a huge difference.  I haven't had time to learn all of the features yet, but so far everything is great.  Apple has not disappointed me with any of their phones and this phone is no exception.  LOVE APPLE, BEST BUY AND THEIR STAFF!!!",5,2019-11-16 12:47:00,"iphone11promax"
"4711",804,"iPhone 11 pro","The only complaint I have about this amazing piece of technology is it is heavy. I’m just not use to the size difference from my old iphone 6s to this massive device. It is hard to hold for long period of time, if you like watching Netflix or other shows on your phone... invest in a stand.",5,2020-01-18 13:50:00,"iphone11promax"
"4712",805,"What a beautiful phone","Has a large bright, crisp display and lots of features. Particularly love the Hey Siri feature to send messages, make phone calls, go to apps, etc. You do need to get some type of cover for it ( I did order one) as the uncovered phone is thin and lightweight and somewhat slick to hold onto - I'd hate to drop this beauty.",5,2020-01-02 10:58:00,"iphone11promax"
"4713",806,"I'm impressed","Just switched from the Galaxy family. Never used an iPhone before and it is very easy now that you can use the SWIPE keyboard. My only 2 complaints are that it is not 5G and it is very expensive, but I knew that before I ought it.",5,2020-01-24 15:31:00,"iphone11promax"
"4714",807,"Great Camera!!!","The night photo option is amazing! It comes out ridiculously Clear!!",4,2019-11-15 17:08:00,"iphone11promax"
"4715",808,"Best of the Best","As always the iPhone's are overpriced but Pro max is the right size screen for my aging eyes. Screen resolution is phenomenal and this year's bionic chip is blazing fast. Did I mention battery life? The best ever on an iPhone and for me the most important feature. STRONGLY RECOMMEND if your wallet can afford it or you get it on sale.",5,2019-12-15 06:16:00,"iphone11promax"
"4716",809,"Amazing camera quality!","I had the 10 XS Max previously. They are both extremely similar. The only difference is the camera quality. The iPhone 10's camera quality is still amazing but there is just a very very very small difference.",5,2020-01-24 16:25:00,"iphone11promax"
"4717",810,"Great new features","I love the new features. The camera is amazing and I have adjusted quickly. It took some time to get used to not having the thumb button but the facial IF is much easier to use when accessing my phone.",5,2020-01-25 14:25:00,"iphone11promax"
"4718",811,"Switched to iPhone 11 Pro Max from Old Samsung","I'm extremely happy with my new iPhone, although I am certainly still learning to use all its features.  I highly recommend this particular model; I am a senior citizen and appreciate the ease of use and especially the size of the screen.  Highly recommend!",5,2020-01-03 18:41:00,"iphone11promax"
"4719",812,"Great camera but still an iphone","Camera is awesome but any new updates that you download , as usual,  slows your phone down upgrade after upgrade. $1400 to last possibly two years.",3,2020-01-11 18:27:00,"iphone11promax"
"4720",813,"LOVE","As a long time iPhone user, this is a great evolution from previous generations.

"4721",814,"Great Phone","I am really happy i popped for this phone over the iPhone 11 or iPhone 11 Pro. The phone's size is just right for me and makes everything easy to read.

"4722",815,"11 pro max","So far I’m loving the cameras ! They pick up all the true colors and I am blown away by the quality.. the phone itself took a little bit of getting used to since I was coming from an iPhone 7plus..",5,2020-01-10 19:55:00,"iphone11promax"
"4723",816,"The price is completely worth it!","I really like the interface in this phone. They made it so easy to use with many shortcuts that really improve the consumer experience. The camera is great for people that care about the quality but not enough to buy a professional camera.",5,2019-12-20 15:18:00,"iphone11promax"
"4724",817,"Simply the best iPhone to date.","It is fast, great battery life, super sharp screen with very realistic color rendition. Best phone camera I’ve ever used.  What else can you say.  This replaced my 5 yr old iPhone 6.",5,2020-01-12 17:53:00,"iphone11promax"
"4725",818,"Perfect Apple","Nothing negative about this. Not a HUGE difference in daily use is noticed from the Xs Max. If you’re looking to upgrade you’ll be satisfied.

"4734",827,"Very good camera, same size footprint of iPhone 7+","I wasn’t expecting to be already happy to have upgraded but I am pleasantly surprised. The one drawback I can say is the new swiping motion compared to pre iPhone X.",5,2019-12-27 15:30:00,"iphone11promax"
"4735",828,"Great phone! Fast and easy to use.","My first Iphone! I thought the Samsung S10 + was the best ever. I purchased this phone for a specific app developed to work blu-tooth with new hearing aids. The app is great and the phone is amazing.",5,2019-12-06 17:22:00,"iphone11promax"

"4742",835,"Camera upgrade","Not much different beside the camera from my XS max it’s heavier which is a minus.

"4759",852,"Bring back the thumbprint scanner","I traded in an 8Plus for the 11 Pro Max. Functionally, there is very little difference between the two. The camera on the 11 is definitely better (but the 8Plus was really good anyway), the battery lasts longer and the fast charger is good.  Speedwise it a little slicker but not by much. My gripe with this phone is the facial recognition. It is inconvenient and aggravating. You really have to get the right angle to be recognized, and if you pick up your phone a lot, having to swipe and hold the phone to your face only to have to type in the passcode or reswipe again, becomes aggravating and wears on you. Also, if you wear sunglasses, you need to remove them for it to work.  Extremely inconvenient. The thumbprint scanner was solid and almost never failed.  This is a great phone in almost all respects, but the inconsistent facial recognition performance is enough to knock not just one but two stars off for me.  In hindsight, I wish I had kept my 8Plus and waited for something better down the road. Save your money and wait for something better.",3,2019-11-19 08:36:00,"iphone11promax"

For a basic iphone 64gb i trade it in to a Samsung galaxy note 10plus u can multitask and comes with 256gb memory 12gb of ram it completely destroys iphone in terms of specs 4gb or ram and 64gm memory - Come on apple wake up and restructure your business.

"4881",974,"Windows Phone Was SOO Much Better","I've been using Windows Phone for years.  Finally made the change to iPhone.  It feels like I've gone back in time by 5 years!  My phone is no longer a ""smart"" phone, it is an aggravating dumb phone!  iOS is awful at allowing me to use my phone the way I want!  Tried getting custom ringtones, and that was a grueling ordeal.  Tried downloading files to the phone and it was a nightmare.  Calendar doesn't work as well as Windows Phone, Contacts on iPhone are a nightmare mess of a disaster with no rhyme or reason to the photo associated with them. My wife told me to stop thinking logically and just feel good about my phone.  That's the Apple experience in a nutshell.

The phone itself is nice hardware, but my screen cracked after 3 days while the phone was in my pocket!  Not my back pocket, in my front pocket!  Forbes wrote an article about this problem with the iPhone 11 models.  I tried taking it back for exchange but Best Buy refused to take it. They said I had to buy Apple Care for $200 then pay another $30 to have the screen fixed.  On a $1,200 phone that is less than a week old.

The battery life is incredible on this phone.  Lasts 4 days between charging.  Charging takes about 1-2 hours.

iOS is almost catching up to Windows (5 years late).  It finally has a built in swipe keyboard, and it finally has dark mode.  But most things I try to do with iOS are more like I'm fighting and battling my phone rather than the phone helping me.  Don't even bother trying to get all your photos to display in the photos app... I have to go to each separate app like OneDrive or iCloud to see photos in each location.  Windows Phone was so much better in almost every way... I can't comprehend why people settled for this inferior clunky pain in the neck OS on their phones.",1,2019-12-27 10:36:00,"iphone11promax"

"4886",979,"Worst IPHONE EVER!!!!!!","The IPHONE 11 Pro Max is the worst phone I have ever had.
I have had IPhones for 20 years and this is the worst.  Cant get calls and make calls.  Drops calls all the time.  I have spent two (2) afternoons at Apple store and still have a terrible problem.  Phone doesnt even show that people have called. ( no missed calls) 
APPLE NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING AS I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS THIS PROBLEM.",1,2019-11-21 19:17:00,"iphone11promax"
"4887",1,"Very happy so far","Have spent a few days with the device. It is definitely pricey, but from the user experience point of view, I am pretty happy with the device so far. Here are a few things:

1, The Face ID works well 99% of the time. Pretty responsive, too. For those with glasses I would suggest capture the FaceID with glasses off. 

2, I like its front camera portrait mode. Could take much better selfies. The stage lighting portrait effect could use some improvement, though. The rear camera works better than the 8plus/7plus in low light situations, and generally provides greater contrast and details. 

3, The size is just right. I feel the 8plus is too big, but this one is just about right. I do prefer the size if used without a case, but there's no way I am doing that. The phone has a sleek look and nice finish. Stainless steel frame gives it some extra shine. 

4, It definitely needs a case to protect its fragile glass back. 

5, the wireless charging is a plus. But it charges rather slowly, since I mostly use the iPad USB charger. 

6, the OLED screen is gorgeous. Better images all together. Apple says it helps save battery life. I will see about that. 

Verdict: if you are on the fence between 8Plus/8 and X and have the extra budget to spare, go with the X.",5,2017-11-06 22:54:00,"iphoneX"

"4894",8,"Is a nice phone","It tak a lot of time to unblock the phone and you literally have to steering at the phone 
I think finger security was 10 tim s better",3,2018-07-27 17:24:00,"iphoneX"
"4895",9,"Solid option","I’ve been using this phone for a little over 2 weeks now and finally feel ready to review it. First, if you’re familiar with iPhones you will have to go through a learning curve to get used to the changes in how you’ll need to use gestures to do what you’ve been used to doing before now. Don’t worry though...you adjust quicker than you can imagine and will find yourself “forgetting” how to do things the old way when you pick up an older iPhone afterwards lol.

 Losing the home button is not as traumatic as some seem to think. Face ID is fast and has been pretty spot on for me. Coming from a Plus model will take some time to adjust to. You will feel like the phone is significantly smaller. You’re right to a certain degree. The extra body you’re used to with the top and bottom bezels make you feel like you’re downsizing but you have to remember that the X screen is bigger (technically) so you’re mainly just loosing the extra none usable space (other than the home button since that was absolutely usable). The X screen is longer but slightly less wide the Plus models. As apps slowly start to update and utilize the full screen your experience gets better. Until then some people will complain and want to bail on the X after just a little handling time. Ultimately you’ll have to handle it and see what your patience level is to see if this phone will work for you. 

The notch...its heavily debated and will bug some people. Again, it’s something you have to gauge for yourself because what bothers you may not bother me (I don’t mind the notch or the size for example). 

Camera is great as always. Some features are more gimmicky than others (Animoji for example is entertaining but not something I’ll likely use much) but as with every phone on the planet some things are just fun perks that may or may not be used. 

The glass...has some people extremely nervous. The answer for that is pretty simple...invest in a case if you’re concerned. I personally almost always use a case so it doesn’t bother me. I didn’t have a case for the better part of the past 2 weeks, dropped my phone a couple of times, but didn’t experience any cracks or anything. But I’m generally careful with my devices so I’ve never experienced a crack (knock on wood). I would suggest investing in AppleCare or insurance if you’re worried about repairs though because the cost is more expensive than ever (check the Apple website for info). Again, that’s a judgement call. It’s not a requirement but if you know you tend to be rough on your devices and don’t want to have to pay expensive repair fees you would benefit from getting AppleCare or some other coverage. 

Ultimately, I truly enjoy my upgrade to the X. No issues so far. The size is great to me but yes, it took some time to get used to. The gestures are super easy. And Face ID has been more accurate than Touch ID for me (not that Touch ID was a problem. It just had issues registering my fingerprint at least twice a day. FaceID has only failed me if my eyes weren’t open or if the phone isn’t able to see my face because of where I am when it tries to scan me). But overall I enjoy the X and think it was a perfect upgrade for me.",5,2017-12-08 17:32:00,"iphoneX"
"4896",10,"It doesn't get better!","This is the best phone I have ever owned! I just switched from Android to iPhone. One thing that kept me from switching is that I never did like iPhone's physical home button. The iPhone X changed that. Honestly, I purchased this phone for the high quality camera. I sold a bunch of pro camera gear to buy it. Not only is the camera amazing, with a lot of features I've never even knew existed, the phone just plain & simply operates so smoothly. 
Pros: amazing camera, fluid like operation, everything just makes sense, phone is fast, screen auto adjusts to lighting conditions, dual speakers, phone call quality is fantastic, the colors are amazing, I liked how in case of emergency, help can access your medical conditions and blood type without breaking into the phone, apps operate smoothly, it's pocket-able, the screen size is perfect (not too small or too big), some apps have more built-in features on iPhone than Android, 
Cons: The only thing that I can think of at all is the price but then again, this is like carrying around a mini mac book pro in your pocket. 
If you're ever in the San Marcos TX area, go see Wesley on the weekends. He is their Apple expert. I don't think there is anything that he doesn't know. I went to him 2 weekends in a row asking him questions before pulling the trigger. It's one of the best purchases I have ever made and I'm an extremely frugal guy. I can honestly say that I feel good about the purchase. And for anyone interested in knowing this, because I wasn't sure of it myself, I purchased this iPhone unlocked and took it to my cell phone carrier Metro-PCS and it works amazing! My friend has an iPhone on Sprint and we've done tests side by side and mine beats his every time.",5,2018-09-22 19:26:00,"iphoneX"
"4897",11,"Samsung to iPhone","Was a Samsung guy since the Galaxy s4, bough a Note 8 when it launched. I found myself tired of constant apps quitting, slow speed, and other miscellaneous errors. Decided to grab an iPhone X and I can go on and on about how impressed I am, the new iPhone X and the operating system blows Android and Samsung so far out of the water, that I decided to purchase a MacBook Pro (currently trying to sell my Lenovo Y700), personally i like my MacBook just as much as my Lenovo running Windows 10 Pro but because of how impressed I am with my three week old iPhone X I purchased an Apple Watch Series 3... wayyy better than my Samsung Gear but at a slightly high price.

Pros: Smooth, Stylish, Fast, Reliable, Efficient, Jaw-Dropping Camera, works perfectly with my MacBook Pro and Apple Watch

Cons: I wish they made a ""Plus"" version, I am a fan of the Note 8s huge screen, and although the X has less pixel density it has a much higher contrast and color which provides a better picture... would complain about the price but my Note 8 costed the same (Note 8 is overpriced)",5,2018-04-20 23:31:00,"iphoneX"
"4898",12,"Finally iPhone with OLED!","Been waiting for so long with an iPhone with OLED screen. This phone takes a little getting used to when it comes to no physical home button or fingerprint scanner. But I noticed Face ID literally works 95% of the time every time I try it. The speakers are louder on this phone and also somehow my Bluetooth headphones seem to get louder also. The battery life is even better than the 7 plus I had. It also feels way better in your hand I recall dropping my 7 plus on my face countless times or not being able to reach every corner of the screen without using reach assist. Overall this is a really good phone",5,2017-11-11 01:42:00,"iphoneX"
"4899",13,"Best Device so Far....period","It's expensive...I know, I get it. But if you live on your device for work and personal reasons like me you want to drive a Ferrari -if possible. 
This device is a Ferrari! The processor is quick and responsive, the screen is brilliant and the exterior looks and feels very high end.
If you can afford it ( trade in your existing device!) you should treat yourself to this incredible machine...",5,2017-11-10 14:00:00,"iphoneX"
"4900",14,"Love the smaller footprint of this phone!","iPhone has done it, made the perfect phone for me. This replaced my iPhone 7+, which I had because of my 45 year old eyes. However, it was too big for my smaller hands. This iPhone X is perfect for me. The screen seems to be about the same size, but the phone has a much smaller footprint. I am so glad to finally have the phone I have wanted. This phone takes great pictures, and the gestures are very easy to figure out, I do not miss the home button at all. I have had the phone for 3 days. The battery lasts all day, I take it off the charger at 5:15, and when I put it back on the charger at night at 10, it is at like 40%. Face ID works most of the time, and I do find it better than using my finger. I think if you are on the fence about this iPhone 10, just go and play with it a bit at the store. It really is an awesome phone. I would also like to say that getting the phone at BestBuy and working with their phone people was the best. So much better than the service I got at the Verizon store. I highly recommend the iPhone X and BestBuy!!!",5,2017-11-12 09:12:00,"iphoneX"
"4901",15,"Great iPhone once again.","Awesome design and quality, feels so smooth in your hand. I have owned it for a couple years now and have zero complaints, I now have it to my

"4902",16,"Worth the money","Earlier, tried all different apple iPhones older than iphone X. This one is definitely better with a Face ID. Large screen. Excellent camera. Magnificient screen display. Easy to use. With new discounts coming up every week at best buy and at other retailers, we should definitely get this one. Worth the money you pay for.",5,2019-07-22 14:49:00,"iphoneX"
"4903",17,"Meh, not worth the price...","I was on an iPhone 7+ and decided to move to the iPhone X when my daughter upgraded her phone to an X. I really didn't like it, which is disappointing. 

I liked the face recognition, but it wasn't perfect and without a fingerprint scanner, at times I had to maneuver the thing around my face to get an unlock. The notch didn't bother me at all but the narrowness of the screen really played havoc with watching video. You either dealt with a smaller window with bars or used the zoom for full screen but lost part of the picture. 

Another frustrating thing was on the iPhone X, you no longer have the ""Zoomed"" display option. I always ran my 7+ in Zoomed mode to slightly enlarge all the text and icons. Since that doesn't exist on the X, I felt like I downgraded to a smaller iphone 7 and it became annoying.

In evaluating things, I really didn't really feel like the price was worth what you get, especially for the 256gb version. It's just not worth the $15/mo extra premium above the iphone 8+ to me. At the end of the day, I decided to return it and I eventually went with the Galaxy S9+.

I'll probably take another look at the X series in an iteration or two, once Apple figures it out better with a bigger version and brings the price down to more comparable levels.",3,2018-03-31 20:01:00,"iphoneX"
"4904",18,"Love the design, but already problematic in cold","I've had every iPhone from 4 up to 7, then sprung for this one. The battery life for all iPhones I've had is much worse in the very cold weather -- yesterday, the first cold day in NYC this year, the battery died 99-0% in less than 30 minutes outside.

Still an amazing phone, but beware of that issue.",4,2017-11-11 11:28:00,"iphoneX"
"4905",19,"My first Apple phone","I was an android fanboy and never thought I would go Apple. After paying $800 for an S8+, using it for 6 months only to have it slow down and glitch through animations, I thought where do I turn now. I traded the phone in and decided to give the new notch phone a try for the 14 day return period. I was initially shocked at what experiencing a true “buttery” UI was really like. This phone is so smooth, extremely fast and the animations have never dropped a frame. The gesture based UI is natural and a smoother, chill way to use your phone, rather than hunting for a button to tap and then tapping it. You just swipe around in different ways and at some point you will do it without thought. I’ve had this phone over a year and it’s operating the same as the day I unboxed it. Expensive phone but I don’t see myself upgrading for a total of three years use, where I was itching to upgrade an android phone after 18 months. Yes, buy this phone.",5,2019-02-17 16:53:00,"iphoneX"
"4906",20,"Almost Perfect!","Of several iPhones I’ve owned over the years, this is by far my favorite yet. It is fast and sleek, durable (it’s been dropped without sustaining damage...with case and tempered glass screen protector of course), the display has brilliant colors, the camera has crisp resolution and many advanced features, and on top of all this it’s small enough to easily fit in a pocket or small purse.

Why four stars instead of five? This model is missing one critical feature that my last iPhone had...fingerprint recognition. I don’t care for facial id (my son is sneaky and can hold it up to my face unexpectedly for unauthorized access) so I use a 6 digit passcode instead. This comes with a trade-off though; the lack of a home button at the bottom of the screen provides more usable screen space in a smaller package. If Apple could simply use a rear button like its competitors for fingerprint recognition, this phone would have a solid five star rating.",4,2019-07-19 12:21:00,"iphoneX"

"4909",23,"I like it.","I bought this model phone when it came out, and it was solid until I dropped it, putting it in my pocket.  It was in a case and there was no outside damage but something happened inside.  The Wifi and Bluetooth stopped working. I choose to pay it off and replace it with the same phone in a different color.  I'm happy with my decision and have had no issues with the new one.  I'm planning on not upgrading and going to rock this one for a while.  This phone is amazing.​",5,2019-08-02 16:49:00,"iphoneX"
"4910",24,"Best phone for the money","Did a bunch of research and the consensus was that iPhone X was a better deal than xr or xs and that proved to be true. Best Buy had a really great price but much more important was that they were able to help my daughter set up her new phone. They also gave us fair trade in gift cards for the old phones. Only issue was when Verizon tried to charge us a monthly payment even though I paid cash in full. Better communication between Best Buy and Verizon would’ve been helpful.",5,2019-07-12 21:44:00,"iphoneX"

"4912",26,"Great battery life","This phone is definitely a step up from my last (Samsung galaxy S8) and from other iPhones. I had an iPhone prior to having the Samsung. I originally switched to Samsung because I was tired of the same boring iPhone that hadn’t been redisigned in years, and I’m happy to say that the newer models are definitely different and better. The battery life is something else though, very powerful!! I use it the same amount that o used my old phone, and it lasts most of the day without a charge and heavy use. The camera is great, but takes some getting used to. The phone itself is also beautiful, I hate to put a case on it cause I like to show it off, but alas I can’t afford to break it after purchasing this with cash! The price a downfall, but I also purchased the 2 years of apple care and I’m always pleased with what their customer service is like.",5,2019-01-12 09:12:00,"iphoneX"

"4918",32,"My girlfriend likes, scratch that, loves her new X","I purchased this for my girlfriend as an early Christmas present. She was upgrading from a regular 6 and couldn’t be happier. The Face ID feature really is a game changer. If you think you will miss Touch ID, don’t, and here is why... It has a feature that will automatically quiet notifications, rings, and alerts when it knows you’re looking at the phone. Super cool! No need to silence an incoming call right away. Also, whenever you open an app you no longer need to place your finger again. It automatically recognizes that it’s you and unlocks the app. You can also easily reply to a text right on the lock screen because the phone has already recognized that you are the authorized user. The gestures are really simple and accurate. I got myself one too. It was an upgrade from a 7 256GB. I hated the 7. Had issues all the time.

Well 4 years later it looks like Apple has ironed these out and I can gladly say I'm very happy with the facial recognition in this phone. Was waiting for Apple to finally do something that was new, and they delivered spectacularly.

I was sceptical but I loved the way it looked. I figured if it’s just as bad as the 7 with glitches, it’s like having the same phone but at least it will look good doing it hahaha. So far I have had very few problems. The only thing that seems to happen, is when an app stretches the wrong way. Im not sure how to describe it, it’s like the x to close whatever may be open is in the far top left with the time rather than a little lower. When that happens you need to force close the app. It has happened 3 times and its impossible to replicate. Overall this iPhone has brought me hope that Apple may not be as far gone as I thought. I hope they focus on QA and having software that has no bugs like it was for so long. Also I miss having the plus.

It's great until the next one comes out, like everything these days.",4,2019-10-11 23:01:00,"iphoneX"
"4940",54,"Great phone for Apple fans","Although it takes some getting used to, the lack of home button on the device doesn’t bother you as much as you’d assume. After not too long you begin to swipe up to get to your home screen and you forget all about having a physical home button. I do miss the Touch ID though as the Face ID sometimes has difficulty in low-lighting. That too you begin to get accustomed to using, and it adapts to you and you to it overtime.",5,2018-09-28 22:54:00,"iphoneX"
"4941",55,"My pictures have never been better","I am an avid traveler that loves photographing EVERYTHING. I do not always feel like lugging around camera equipment but have found my iPhone to take great pics that many have felt were taken with professional equipment.",5,2019-08-21 23:21:00,"iphoneX"
"4942",56,"The best IPhone yet!","With a bigger screen than the plus models and a smaller footprint. The new iPhone already had a lot going for it, then add wireless charging, face ID, and the new more powerful chip shared with the other models. You come up with the most advanced iPhone the world has seen. It feels good in the hands. A camera that has to be seen in action to fully appreciate the quality, agile transitions between apps, stereo speakers, and the apple eco system that unites all your apple devices all coming together to give you the experience that's worth the upgrade to the iPhone 10. I guess X really does mark the spot.",5,2018-01-18 08:34:00,"iphoneX"
"4943",57,"Best phone ever","Have always had a Galaxy phone and finally moved to apple. The Face ID is so easy compared to have a code to type in. No home button was easy to get use to. It seem fast to use this phone then any other.",5,2017-11-14 09:56:00,"iphoneX"
"4944",58,"Love/hate relationship","Love the screen size, overall size of phone, speed, facial recognition is pretty easy. Camera is excellent. Do not like how sensitive the side buttons are. I’ve talked with my friends and they have the same issues:  screen shots when you’re not trying, butt calls, inadvertent SOS calls.  I know there are some operator errors, but It also locks up at least once a week. I switched from a 7 and quite frankly, had zero issues with the 7. I’d recommend, but with some reservations.",4,2019-07-05 17:28:00,"iphoneX"
"4945",59,"Love this phone!","At first I was hesitant about whether l wanted to upgrade to the X or the 8 plus and I’m so glad I went I went with the X. First, the size is absolutely perfect. I am a previous user of the 6 plus and it felt too big at times. This fits right in your hand and is the perfect size. It Doesn’t feel too small at all. The full size screen is awesome. I don’t even miss having a home key button at all. In fact after a couple of days of using this I completely forgot about it. Most of all, this camera is amazing. When using portrait mode pictures look professional and came out way better than I ever thought. This is one of the best phones I ever had. You cannot go wrong with the iPhone X",5,2018-08-03 22:04:00,"iphoneX"
"4946",60,"Yes it’s that good!","This phone is definitely the best iPhone yet. The Face ID is super easy and fast. The cameras are amazingly crisp and awesome portrait modes. The battery life is good and the wireless charging is a snap. Yes, Android folks are going to say we had a lot of it first, but I find iPhones are a lot simpler and user friendly when you’re not a computer genius that likes to jailbreak everything. Also, they don’t get all the viruses that androids do because they don’t let all the infected apps through. Well that’s my two cents at least. Take it for what it’s worth. I’m enjoying it very much.",5,2017-12-20 06:11:00,"iphoneX"
"4947",61,"Most improved iPhone to date","I've been through many iterations of iPhones (and Android phones, but that's another story) and the iPhone X is the most impressive and most improved iPhone to date. The things I love most are the new screen and the wireless charging. The OLED screen is a sight to behold. True Samsung has had them for years, but the color accuracy of the Samsungs aren't very good. They are vibrant, but not accurate. Watching videos, netflix and itunes, in HDR on this is quite nice. Also, yes it's true that Android phones have already had wireless charging in their phones for some time, so now to have it on iPhone is a very welcome addition. At work I have a Qi wireless charging stand and it works fantastically for both vertical and horizontal phone orientations.

Also another thing to note: having come from the Plus version of the iPhone to the X was a pretty noticeable change, but after only a couple of days usage, the smaller physical form factor size is a non-issue.",5,2017-11-17 12:42:00,"iphoneX"
"4948",62,"Best iPhone Ever!","I was looking to upgrade from my iPhone 7 and debating whether I should go with the larger screen of iPhone 8+. However, I just don’t like the feel of the larger phones in my hand. So, the choice came down to the smaller iPhone 8 or the iPhone X. After researching both I was still undecided if the X was worth the extra money. Until one day I was in Best Buy and I placed my 7 on top of the X and saw it was basically the same size and had a much larger screen. That made it an easy choice!

I love the face recognition, the beautiful detail of the new screen, and the upgraded camera. I’m an avid amateur photographer and I always scoffed at phone cameras. Not anymore!

The only bad thing about getting the iPhone X is that my wife loved mine so much that I had to buy her one too! She had the 7+ and loves the X’s screen too!",5,2018-03-09 20:28:00,"iphoneX"

"4950",64,"Best iPhone yet","The iPhone X is easily the best iPhone yet, love the fact of the viewable portion of the screen is larger than the 8+, yet the phone is smaller than the 8+ and only a fraction larger than 8. People complain that apple’s technology seems behind however I would offer that none of the technology is “glitchy“ and works seamlessly and flawlessly which is a win over most android phones. People also complained of the phone is $1000 when I would offer that I never hear anybody complaining that the newest Google pixel is right at about $1000 As well as the new Samsung Is in the same boat.",5,2017-12-02 04:50:00,"iphoneX"
"4951",65,"Slick and Convenient","I love the new IPhone 10 (aka X). It takes about a day to get used to not having the home button. However once you are used to it you will find it is very convenient switching between app to app without it. I love the large storage and am no longer afraid of having to pick and choose which apps to keep and which to delete. Best Buy had the best deal which allowed me to trade in my old phone to get a Best Buy gift card. This could be used for the tax on the phone, a down payment towards it if you are choosing to finance it, or accessories. I purchased a case, glass protection, a wireless charger, paid the tax on the phone and still had money leftover. Would definitely recommend over trading into your phone service provider. The large screen is excellent and sound is very clear. The camera works so swell you can see sweat droplets! Very satisfied with my purchase.",5,2018-01-16 03:01:00,"iphoneX"

"4954",68,"Not that great","I couldn't decide between the 8+ or the X but chose the X since it was closer in size to the iPhone 6s I was upgrading from and I'm honestly not that impressed. Yes, the camera is great on it, but honestly that's about the only good feature this has to offer. I really don't like having Face ID and I wish I could go back to using the thumbprint. Face ID barely works half the time, I've added my face to it under multiple lightings so it would.The first week I had it it froze for a solid 15min. It has cool features and all but it's really not all it's hyped up to be. I thought I was the only one who thought this because I've been on the fence about returning it or not, but what other options are there really? Several people I know who have also recently upgraded aren't that impressed with it either. Be prepared to google how to do most things on it when you first get it because apple made it way more confusing than it needs to be. My main complaint about the phone really is the face ID, other than that, it's a phone, it works, it's just not that great. If you want a phone similar in size to a 6 though, this is the way to go instead of the 8+ unfortunately.",3,2018-06-04 10:17:00,"iphoneX"
"4955",69,"I really love the new IPhone .","It’s everything you love about the IPhone with a few more bells and whistles. Face recognition scanning, Better gaming graphics, the screen looks amazing with added Samsung OLED technology, and really with no headphone jack really doesn’t matter (if don’t have a Bluetooth headset get one. It’s 2017!) . Camera really takes great pictures. I’ve liked the way IPhone has done things for the last 10 yrs, and this a brilliant Design and has amazing battery life. It’s not a customizable as Android phones, if your into that check out the Samsung line up.",5,2017-12-21 21:50:00,"iphoneX"
"4956",70,"FaceID - Game Changer","I am coming from a 6S plus and decided to take up the BOGO on the iPhone 8 when I bought the iPhone X.

The X is very different from my 6S plus in that it is physically smaller but the overall screen size is about the same. I really enjoy the smaller form factor.

The biggest difference is FaceID. It takes a bit of getting used to but that won't take long. Now, about a month into ownership, going back to TouchID seems foreign and bit outdated. One thing that I don't like about FaceID is that you can't really use it while in bed - it a bit picky on the angle that it needs to pick up your face.",5,2018-08-24 12:37:00,"iphoneX"
"4957",71,"Better Than Expected","I was a little reluctant to go back to Apple but I have been very happy with the iPhone X.

"4963",77,"Good but not great","The screen is big and beautiful and the camera takes great photos and videos. The lack of a home button is akward, and having to swipe up from the bottom can be a nuisance (very easy to hang up on someone if you try to unlock your phone while in the middle of a call, for instance). Also, the FaceID feature is unreliable, working about half the time when trying to unlock my phone or download an app. Overall I think the 8 Plus would be a better choice, especially for the price difference.",4,2017-11-25 06:15:00,"iphoneX"
"4964",78,"Huge Upgrade!","Such a great upgrade to my very outdated iPhone 5. I was worried it would be difficult to get a hang of it, but it was actually very simple and, after watching a couple of brief youtube videos, I would say I was almost 100% functional as compared to my old phone.",5,2019-05-30 11:42:00,"iphoneX"
"4965",79,"Mush better than expected","The iPhone X experience has been a wild pleasant surprise. My first thoughts was that it was a so-so update....I WAS DEAD WRONG!!! Slightly larger screen.....but the X takes the image all the way to the edges, so much more impactful than I thought! Facial recognition??? also thought this was a ho-hum improvement.....WRONG AGAIN. The facial recognition is incredible. Next the absence of the action button at the bottom of the screen...WOW...it is just now a SWIPE!

All in all the X is worth the money, though I really believe the price should be -$200!

"4966",80,"Excellent phone!","I love this phone! I've tried all of the current Apple phones (8, 8+, & X) and I find this to be the perfect phone, for me. I love the large screen of the 8+ but I can't hold the 8+ in one hand and type/navigate - with the X I can. Of course I can with the 8 as well but the 8 lacks the camera of the 8+ and the X (maybe Apple should consider giving the 8 the same camera as the +?) I realize this phone still has it's kinks to work out and I would like some kind of touch sensor when I can't pick it up and look at it, but it's a great phone! When people talk about comparing the screen of the X to the 8/8+ you can definitely tell the difference in the quality and clarity.",5,2018-04-23 11:28:00,"iphoneX"
"4967",81,"My son loves it","This is my son's first iPhone. He and I have always been on android, though his other siblings have had iPhones for years. Finally, as his old phone started to have issues, he decided to upgrade. He went with the iPhone X because all of his friends are on iPhones, so it lets him chat with them in group chats like the rest of them do (sorry, don't remember the name of the iChat or whatever the group chat program that they use is).
He's very happy with it.
A bit of a learning curve switching to the new phone, but within one evening of playing with it he was up to speed and he loves it.",5,2018-07-12 15:21:00,"iphoneX"

"4969",83,"Nice, but expensive","The iPhone X screen size is nice for a phone that is also smaller and lighter weight than an 8 Plus. Processing is fast, and the dual-camera photo options make taking pictures easier and better. The use of additional swipe and 3D touch motions instead of a home button is a little more cumbersome. Overall a nice phone, but if you don't mind the size of the iPhone 8 Plus, not sure the X is worth the added cost.",5,2018-05-19 20:04:00,"iphoneX"

However, the declining battery life is nothing new for iphone users. One time my phone freaked out where it froze and the screen would not turn off and it was not sending me notifications, but I could see that I was getting messges.

Being so ingrained in Apple's ecosystem (iPad, Apple TV, MacBook), I got frustrated and finally bit the bullet to switch back. I was skeptical about the face unlock, but it really does work seamlessly. The team at apple truly is the best at understanding functionality, as I was navigating without a home button like a pro within an hour (also something I was nervous about).

The OLED screen is beautiful and the all screen display is wonderful (besides the notch, which doesn’t really bother me). Only reason I give it 4 stars and not 5 is because the price tag is ridiculous. You can buy a much better phone as far as specs go for a much cheaper if not half the price but because it’s an Apple phone the price of over $1000 is outrageous. Only reason I bought this phone for me and my wife is because we both had iPhone 5s and it was slowing down tremendously and battery draining like a gas leak. We are both Apple fans because we love the simplicity of it and most of my family has an iPhone which makes iMessage and FaceTime a must for us. Other than the outrageous price tag this is a great phone. Dropped it a few times already (with a simple bumper case) and noticed zero damage to it.",4,2018-07-23 18:26:00,"iphoneX"

Having 256GB is great. Can download movies and take lots of pictures and videos.
Silver finish looks very good, recommend Urban Armor Gear (UAG) cases with it.
Not as advanced as the new iPhone XS, but advanced enough to last a very long time (honestly, there’s not much of a noticeable difference between the two iPhones).
Face ID works very well, however in some cases (like laying in bed on your side), it has a hard time recognizing your face and this is where Touch ID might be preferred. In most cases, Face ID is quicker and easier than Touch ID (and more fun with the new Memoji and Animoji).
Having the “all screen” display is great and looking back at older iPhones, it’s just not the same as you would think.

Was somewhat concerned that the lack of a home button would make going back and forth between iPod and iPhone X confusing, but that hasn't been the case. The new process is, if anything, easier, and the devices are different enough that I have had no tendency to try to use the wrong set of movements on either.

"4997",111,"Awesome Phone","I have greatly enjoyed my new Apple iPhone x. The new technology is awesome & the sleek phone is so easy to carry.
I got a Great Price & used my Rewards toward the purchase. 
I Love Best Buy Rewards!!!!",5,2019-06-11 09:37:00,"iphoneX"
"4998",112,"My kid loves this phone","Purchased this phone for my teen. First time purchasing an iPhone. The features are AWESOME! the camera is the best I've seen on a cell phone. Awesome interactive games. Also. If you own an apple computer or laptop and use iTunes. When you add music to your library it automatically syncs to your phone. How cool! I will be switching to 
an iPhone.",5,2019-01-09 08:00:00,"iphoneX"
"4999",113,"I'm glad I took the plunge","I use my phone a lot. For work, for play, and anything in between, my phones get a lot of use. They connect us to the world through apps and the internet. I use mine to look up information all the time. Not to mention as a camera, GPS, flashlight, radio, and the list just goes on and on.

I had been on the fence with my 6s for a while debating if it was worth going for the X or just getting an 8. I'm glad I went with the X. The new features of the X simply work, and feel very natural.

Now if gestures, FaceID, and some of the additional new features don't matter to you, then an 8 will suite you just fine. You could say that the iPhone X is for ""enthusiasts"" .",5,2017-12-15 14:53:00,"iphoneX"
"5000",114,"Great phone","This was a great phone when I purchased it. However the battery life didn’t hold up.",5,2019-10-05 12:46:00,"iphoneX"
"5001",115,"Great Phone, Best Iphone Yet","I have had this phone for 2 weeks. The gentleman who sold me the phone was very knowledgable about the Iphone and gave me the tools I needed to deal with the lack of a home button. Now, I wonder why we ever needed a home button to begin with. This is a solid phone, slightly bigger than my old Iphone 6 but with a great screen that is bigger than my wife's Iphone 6 Plus. Battery life is great, after 2 days use, I still have about 50% battery. I have no complaints. Apple Forever. I need to get a new Ipad Pro.",5,2018-06-27 20:49:00,"iphoneX"
"5002",116,"Great iPhone of the Times","I’ve been using this phone for the past month and I’ve already transitioned from using a home button to swiping up in It’s place. I’ve also gotten used to it’s size and speed, it’s unmatched in most of its specs to the iPhone 7 that I did have and I appreciated the help of the Best Buy employees that helped me get this phone.",5,2019-01-25 17:46:00,"iphoneX"
"5003",117,"Switched from Galaxy","Switched from my Galaxy S8 to get my first iPhone since the iPhone 4. I am not disappointed. Love my iPhone X",5,2019-09-06 19:10:00,"iphoneX"

"5005",119,"Liking the change to iPhone X","We needed to upgrade to iPhone for a specific service app my wife needs. I love my new iPhone X. I am still learning how to do things which I found easy to do on my last phone, but this pone can do so much more. About half way in the learning curve.",5,2019-04-12 18:03:00,"iphoneX"
"5006",120,"Love Apple Products","Great phone. User friendly. As long as you manage your pictures & videos properly, 256GB capacity goes a long way. My kids love that it is waterproof as it allows you to take underwater pictures.",5,2019-06-08 05:55:00,"iphoneX"

"5008",122,"Still beats flagships phones after 1.5 years","Still going on strong after 1.5 years. No noticeable signs of slowing down, the battery has surprisingly lived up. Wife has dropped it a couple of times but luckily did not shatter the front or back glass - although I did buy apple care just in case. Overall a quality product from Apple.",5,2019-02-26 14:50:00,"iphoneX"

"5012",126,"Great Phone/Camera","Same footprint as iPhone6 but much bigger screen. Love Face ID over fingerprint unlock as the iPhone 6 always seemed to lose or not recognize my fingerprint. Camera produces much better pictures. Loss of home button is no big deal - only took a few days to get used to swiping up from the bottom or various other swipes to replace other actions. Am missing the separate headset jack but plan to order a pair of wireless earbuds and should be good to go.",5,2018-08-03 16:07:00,"iphoneX"
"5013",127,"Great New iPhone X","Amazing Design, Great, Quality feeling phone and device. Upgrading from an iPhone 6, one can definitely tell the difference. The weight increases because of the glass design added for wireless charging. The new cameras are amazing and you’ll love the portrait mode and 4K video capture. Overall great phone and innovation from Apple.",5,2018-12-27 12:05:00,"iphoneX"
"5014",128,"Great Phone","I am very pleased with my purchase. I wish for the price you got a charging pad and the air pods. However, I understand that Apple wants to be able to make money off of those products.

"5016",130,"Best phone I’ve had!","I have had many phones that were Apple and Samsung’s. This phone far out performs any of them! I had the note 8 before this and The retina unlock never really worked so I was skeptical of the facial recognition. This is night and day different. I’ve grown a beard and it still works. Sunglasses on it works. In a pitch black room it works. Apple perfected this! I missed the home button at first but not anymore. I don’t think I’d wanna go back at this point. All in all this phone is just great at how well it does everything I need it too.",5,2018-03-17 10:05:00,"iphoneX"
"5017",131,"Different but great!","The iPhone X is everything advertised. It takes some getting used to but the phone itself is amazing. High quality pictures. The Face ID actually is really protective and works really well even from different angles. I love the fact it has wireless charging capabilities and most important: it’s still an iPhone! The screen size (phone size from the iPhone 7+) isn’t as good as I expected but the fact the screen is so big makes up for this.",5,2018-07-20 18:01:00,"iphoneX"
"5018",132,"Worth the upgrade from the 7 Plus","Like size and facial recognition for sure. Has some bugs that need to be fixed. Worth upgrading if you like the screen size but want to shed the bulk of the 7 Plus. Wireless charging is a nice feature that I like more that I thought I would. Impresssd but not floored.",5,2017-11-17 16:39:00,"iphoneX"
"5019",133,"Awesome phone","This phone is great - easy to adapt to and I continue to discover things it always or will allow me to do.",5,2019-08-21 21:39:00,"iphoneX"
"5020",134,"Love My Phone","This is the original iPhone X and it works just like it's supposed to. It does everything I want it to. It worked very well in Vietnam with an in country chip. This is a great phone",5,2019-05-31 17:05:00,"iphoneX"
"5021",135,"Great evolution of the iPhone","I love this phone! The battery life is better than I expected, the speed & quality of the screen & camera are great except for the hit or miss portrait mode on the camera. The gestures that take the place of the home button seem to be pretty intuitive. The Face ID works better than I thought it was but isn’t perfect. Overall if you are coming from an older phone ( I had an iPhone 5s) I would recommend upgrading!",5,2018-08-18 19:22:00,"iphoneX"
"5022",136,"New favorite","I was Samsung Galaxy phones all the way, even when my husband had an iPhone. Well upgrade time came and I decided to give it a try. I will not be going back to an android as long as Apple keeps their game up. I love this phone. So easy to use and lots of features I still haven’t figured out yet.",5,2019-01-16 18:31:00,"iphoneX"
"5023",137,"Memory and Battery Life","So far, so good with the ability to use phone without worrying about storage or running out of juice! The camera and bigger screen are added bonuses.",5,2019-07-05 17:07:00,"iphoneX"

"5025",139,"Great upgrade","This was a perfect upgrade for me.  I went from the 7 to this and this model was less expensive than one with less memory.",5,2019-08-02 16:51:00,"iphoneX"
"5026",140,"Best phone ever owned.","After years of saying iDont to Apple this phone won me over. A year later still my favorite phone. It’s so good I don’t even have upgrade fever when new phones come out. Which will likely apples fault for not wowing me with their new phones.",5,2019-03-20 18:29:00,"iphoneX"
"5027",141,"Perfect Phone","Absolutely love this phone and all it’s features! The camera is amazing and the pictures are such high quality. Got a great deal for the 256 model, very happy with this purchase.",5,2019-06-01 04:32:00,"iphoneX"
"5028",142,"Nice upgrade","Bought mainly for pictures on a trip to Hawaii. Took great photos and was easy to adjust to this model.",5,2019-08-21 23:19:00,"iphoneX"
"5029",143,"The best iPhone I’ve ever owned","So I’ve owned pretty much every iPhone that has been released save the S series. I’ve owned the 3G, 4, 5, 6Plus, 7 and now the X. This phone is fast and the display is gorgeous. Very bright, vivid and clear. The lack of a home button takes a little getting used to but it’s not hard. The facial recognition option is okay but need improvement. Overall I’m extremely satisfied.",5,2018-10-01 15:27:00,"iphoneX"
"5030",144,"Good phone horrible price","iPhones are top sellers because they're a status symbol. I bought this phone for my mom and it was a huge upgrade for her since she had the iPhone C, she loves it and the screen is beautiful and finally a phone with Amoled made by Samsung. Its fast only down side is the fast charger isn't included it also is super expensive for a phone that dosent have much features like android does. But overall my mom is happy and it's a huge step up from her old 5C",4,2019-03-03 23:48:00,"iphoneX"
"5031",145,"I like it.","It’s a good phone. I really had to upgrade from my iPhone 6 so to me it was a big upgrade. I do sometimes notice that the camera is a little blurry and I have to close the camera app and launch it again and it’s clear. Not sure what that’s about. The phone also heats up pretty quick. Not all the time but sometimes. Other than that I love it. It’s fast.",4,2018-12-19 17:15:00,"iphoneX"
"5032",146,"Awesome phone","Love the new features of the X! The phone itself is smaller than my 6s plus that I had without losing screen size due to the screen going all the way to the edges. Great camara and facial recognition works awesome! Easy to use! Don’t miss the home button at all! The only downfall is that if I’m using the headphones and watching a movie, I can’t charge it at the same time. However, the battery life seems to way improved from my previous iPhone!",5,2018-06-23 09:38:00,"iphoneX"
"5033",147,"Worth It!","Prior to my purchase of the iPhone X, I was debating whether or not it was worth it. My wife has the 8 plus and loves it. I decided to take the leap and commit. I am so glad I did. The clarity of front and rear facing cameras are exceptional. The Animoji is purely awesome! If you are contemplating X vs. 8 plus, unless you are a newbie to Apple, take the plunge. The only thing I am getting used to is no home button, but that is super minor.",5,2018-06-20 19:03:00,"iphoneX"
"5034",148,"Love my 10X","Wow, I’m in love with this iPhone! Face ID works perfectly every time, smooth upward response to open, easy open and close apps. The size is perfect for my smaller hands and lighter than the 7+ I had before....even with the otterbox cover.....fits nice. The sound system is exceptional and the pictures are flawless. I’m very happy with this 10X iPhone....and, oh yea......great as a phone....no garbling notices like the 7+.",5,2018-07-13 14:16:00,"iphoneX"
"5035",149,"its worth every penny","I wasn't planning on getting the iphone x when Apple first made an announcement. I get a new iphone every year. 

However, I couldnt resist and had to make the purchase. But iphone x is the best iphone ever. The battery life is amazing. the battery life alone is worth every penny. Also, once you get used to the hand gestures, you wont miss the home button at all.",5,2017-12-01 16:32:00,"iphoneX"
"5036",150,"Just excited to have a new phone","The X was amazing when it came out   Bought this 6/2018, now 6/2019 there are newer devices, but we still have this phone.  Works great! Camera is amazing!",5,2019-06-19 17:41:00,"iphoneX"
"5037",151,"Great phone - more than I hoped for.","Would have bought it sooner. Was having trouble with my 5S. Finally I had to do something. I really like the X. The whole screen view is great and the no home button took me about 30 seconds to get used to and I'm not a young person. My salesperson, Sydney was a gem. She knew her stuff. Was efficient and actually I ended up buying an apple watch several weeks later as we talked about hers and liked it so well.",5,2018-07-29 15:42:00,"iphoneX"

"5040",154,"Was a Skeptic","Took awhile for me to take the leap and upgrade from my iPhone 6. I am so glad I finally did it!! The iPhone X is a great device!! Thought adjusting from the lack of home button would be tough but it took me about ten minutes to adjust. Face ID is pretty cool and works both with and without my sunglasses on. The screen size and quality are awesome! Camera is amazing! Two thumbs up from me!!",5,2018-08-19 09:12:00,"iphoneX"
"5041",155,"iPhoneX","there is nothing like an iPhoneX just maybe a Samsung. Not sure my friend swears by the Samsung. I highly feel the iPhoneX is the way to go for a very good quality smartphone and support is great",5,2019-04-24 03:28:00,"iphoneX"
"5042",156,"Awesome iPhone","I have had multiple iPhones in the last 5-6 years, but this is my favorite. Love the screen and lack of a home button, after getting used to it. Couldn’t imagine anything else.",5,2019-05-15 17:20:00,"iphoneX"
"5043",157,"Great Phone!","This was actually for my daughter, but she absolutely loves this phone!

I would highly recommend this phone to anyone looking to upgrade.",5,2019-02-15 13:16:00,"iphoneX"
"5044",158,"Why buy your iphone anywhere else?","I replaced an iphone 6+ with a new iphone X this weekend and the experience was outstanding. Not only did they provide top dollar in bestbuy credit for the replacement phone but we got an excellent deal on a case. The bestbuy representative did everything required to setup and transfer all our apps, media, etc. It takes about an hour but we walked out with a new phone, case and some extra credit on a best buy rewards card. Shopping at Apple or a carrier is not as forgiving as shopping at BestBuy. Thank you and great job.",5,2018-01-07 06:46:00,"iphoneX"
"5045",159,"Better than expected","When paying over four digits for a phone you’d expect it to be great. The iPhone X doesn’t disappoint. Every aspect of the phone is amazing from screen, to speakers. Is there room for improvement? Of course, the answer to that will always be yes (that’s why there will be a new iPhone next year). The part I’m referring to that needs improvement is the battery, I use my phone heavily (hours of calls + LTE videos), but for the average user the battery should be sufficient. 5/5 from me, a random guy in the internet.",5,2018-01-17 17:49:00,"iphoneX"
"5046",160,"Sleek","Love this iPhone! My previous phone was the iPhone 6 which was great but the X is just phenomenal. Love the large screen. Functions are amazing and I find new things all the time. A true wonder.",5,2019-04-17 20:16:00,"iphoneX"
"5047",161,"Love the full screen !","Love that it doesn’t have a border around the phone. It works as expected , as it is an up grade from my IPHONE 6. Easy to use too !",5,2019-06-29 09:38:00,"iphoneX"
"5048",162,"Love the camera on this phone!","Really enjoying my purchase so far! I don’t use the creepy facial recognition features, but love the camera quality!",5,2019-07-17 18:19:00,"iphoneX"
"5049",163,"Great upgrade from an iPhone 6","My iPhone 6 was getting really sluggish and I thought long and hard about whether to go for an 8 or an X as an upgrade. I'm so glad I went with the X. It's familiar but different enough that I feel like I got something new. The new features take a little getting used to but overall very happy with my decision. The trade in / upgrade process at Best Buy was great too - totally frictionless experience.",5,2018-06-29 13:04:00,"iphoneX"
"5050",164,"Awesome phone, not worth the upgarde from iPhone 7","I cannot lie, I love my new iPhone X, but I am finding that it is probably not worth the cost of the upgrade from the 7. I suppose if you have an earlier iPhone it may be worth it, but the feature set is not that different. The screen is slightly larger and the facial recognition is neat, but I found the touch ID to be more reliable after a few days of use. Nice phone, not worth the additional cost to upgrade. Oh, and definitely get Applecare... my wife dropped hers before we put a case on it and the back cracked. Very fragile.",4,2018-03-06 10:15:00,"iphoneX"

"5056",170,"Great phone","The iPhone X was a huge gamble from Apple, but one that really paid off. Losing the home button and altering the design was a dangerous move, but one that was sorely needed after years of similarity and the premium design, extra power, all-screen front mix together to create - by far - the best iPhone Apple's ever made. It's impossible to give a perfect score to something that costs this much - but this is the closest to smartphone perfection Apple has ever got.",5,2018-03-10 12:39:00,"iphoneX"

"5058",172,"Overall great phone","The iPhone X has a stunning display and decent size! Although I do miss the overall size of the iPhone 8 Plus that I used to own this phones siz me is great. I do miss the home button but Face ID is not too bad; I find it pretty quick but sometimes cumbersome. The features are pretty much aligned with what we’re accustomed to from apple. It is definitely a much faster phone! Great phone overall. I would definitely would recommend this phone to everyone.",4,2019-01-16 19:51:00,"iphoneX"
"5059",173,"Love this Phone!","At first I was hesitant to buy the iPhone X due to it being smaller than my 6 Plus. Yet, after spending a few hours with it and getting a feel for it, I absolutely love it. It’s operating system is infinitely faster, the ringing feature where the volume is auto adjusted depending on if you’re looking at your phone is pleasing, and Face ID makes unlocking the phone much easier.",5,2018-07-20 17:13:00,"iphoneX"
"5060",174,"Love this product","We used to be Samsung people in tell we had a lot of problems with them then we turned them in and got a iPhone X and I wouldn't turn it in for the world I love it and all you can do with it I am in school and I use my phone a lot and I never have issues with it. I would recommend this to anyone it is a lot better than Samsung. I am a true iPhone lover",5,2018-08-26 15:01:00,"iphoneX"
"5061",175,"Worthy upgrade from an older Iphone","I was “forced” into an upgrade when I dropped my 6 plus and smashed the screen. I was just going to get an 8 plus but decided that it was too similar to my old phone and what something different. I was skeptical of the X but after a couple days with it I’m happy with the direction Apple went with the phone. There were a couple things to get used to such as the lack of the home button and how to get to the quick menu but now I’m acclimated and appreciate the change.",5,2018-02-21 16:40:00,"iphoneX"

"5065",179,"Bought for my mom","I picked this phone up for my mom, she was just loving her iphone 6 plus so I thought she should have the newest device, it took her some time to learn how to function the phone with just gestures, but when she got it down she couldn't be stopped.

"5066",180,"Love the iPhone X","I upgraded from 6 plus to this iPhoneX, love the screen size. Need to get used to no home button, but by second day I did not miss the Home button any more. Easy to take pictures & videos, very clear & sharp. I ended up bought the apple care , because I got nervous for price of iPhone X 256GB that I paid for. Best Buy has a promotion on iPhone X, very good deal. Yes, I also got a nice strong case to protect.",5,2018-05-16 18:15:00,"iphoneX"

"5069",183,"Love the X","I am happy with the purchase. I was concerned about the facial recognition but that has not been an issue. I love the large screen and the camera's Portrait mode is great as well. I did take a bit getting used to the different features from my 6S such as no Home button and swipe from top right for the quick access section. Overall I am very happy with my purchase.",5,2018-07-23 13:06:00,"iphoneX"
"5070",184,"Best one so far","I have used iPhones since VZW started supporting them with the iPhone 4. Later upgraded to a 5S, then a 6 Plus. They continued to get better and better. The Plus increase in size was welcomed, but with a durable case became too bulky to comfortably fit it in your pocket. The iPhone X FaceID when initially announced was not a reason to upgrade, however the accuracy, performance, and form factor make up for a great phone. Perfect size and excellent performance and features.",5,2018-01-19 19:27:00,"iphoneX"
"5071",185,"Great Phone","Upgraded from a 6 SE to this phone and love it. I tend to hold on to old phones for a bit before upgrading, as I like my upgrades to truly be upgrades. While the layout and utilization of the phone is similar, the functionality is obviously much improved. Definitely recommend upgrading to if you haven’t done so already.",5,2018-09-28 16:49:00,"iphoneX"

Face ID works practically each time and is fast. 3rd I love that the battery life is better and last but not least Selfie Portait modes!

Bigger screen is A++++. I couldn't give it 5 stars, however, until I figure out how to do the portrait manipulations with the camera that they showed off in the advertisements... not intuitive at all, so I guess I will have to google or wait for the IPhone guy on Facebook to post helpful hints in order to take advantage of the best aspects of the new camera. Still, picture quality is better than I was getting with the 6S. It only takes a few days to get used to the button-free features... but I was not happy to realize that I can't connect the phone to my car without some kind of bluetooth adaptor. I'll be heading back to best buy for that. Too expensive to just get a new car.",4,2017-11-19 20:19:00,"iphoneX"

It’s fast, the screen is beautiful, and the facial recognition works amazingly. Many complain about that small bump that takes up real estate from the screen. It did bother me at first. After 2 weeks, I don’t seem to notice it anymore. My only complaint is the fingerprint reader unlocked everything faster. I didn’t even need to lift the phone. The facial recognition does work great, but you have to have your face right in front of it. I cant really consider that a flaw, seeing as that is what the phone intends to do.

Everyone of my friends I show how my iphone 6 plus act they were like this is worst than my 5 years old android phone. After using it for more than a month, nothing in this phone really makes me feel like it's a great phone. Major downsize what the screen, this is no 5.8"" screen to me. I hate watching Youtube with the screen blow up and having part of the screen get cut off. Watching it full size the screen are smaller than my iphone 6 plus.

I love how much smaller it is in your hand and pocket than the plus versions of previous models. My only annoyance is that I purchased it online without seeing it. The screen is stated to be bigger than the plus versions of the 6,7, and 8 but the phone is overall smaller because of the narrow bezels. While it technically is true, in the sense of diagonal inches, it is very narrow and tall, so the extra space is unusable. I came from a 7plus and while the screen was technically smaller diagonally, while using it, it felt larger. Because of the narrowness of the X screen, the keyboard is actually smaller than I was used to. All things considered though, great phone.",4,2017-12-04 14:28:00,"iphoneX"

I liked the galaxy eight a little better but this one is pretty close , it just take some interesting getting used to swipe gestures and everything. almost perfect couple things they could improve such as key combinations and things like that but it works really wel. the screen is beautiful and the integration with other Apple products works well.",4,2018-06-20 19:23:00,"iphoneX"

"5159",273,"So far so good","I bought this phone for my 13-year-old daughter. She loves it so far but says it seems to charge slow. To be honest, I don't know if it really charges slow or if it is because she is on it all the time. She listens to music via blue tooth, face times with her friends etc. and all works wonderfully. So not sure if the battery charges slowly or not. That's her only complaint. When school starts and she her time is more limited I am guessing that complaint of hers may disappear. hehe At least I hope it does.",4,2018-08-07 17:57:00,"iphoneX"

"5162",276,"The best in market!","I would say the best phone in market, but lots of money. I love the camera portrait mode, it is awesome, its equivalent to SLR Cams.

"5164",278,"Nice!","I actually started out with the iPhone 8 Plus. That was so big (I had a 7 before) and very heavy. I decided to spend the extra money to get the iPhone X. I am so happy that I did!!! It is fast, the screen quality is excellent and I love the camera. It is a little heavier than the 7 but much better size and weight than the plus size.

"5174",288,"The future in your hands","If you don’t think the extra $200 vs the 8 is worth it, think again. Having a screen larger then the plus that fits in your hand feels amazing and really does feel like the future.

"5190",304,"Intuitive","Of all the upgrades to the iPhone X, none are more impressive than the camera features.

The facial recognition doesn't work as perfectly as I had hoped, but I am still giving it 5 stars. You just have to be sure the phone is held up and aimed right at your face.

"5196",310,"FANTASTIC!","I was hesitant about spending the money for the X, but figured I use my phone more than any other device in life, so might as well splurge. This thing is fantastic.

"5212",326,"Close to perfect","The iPhone X is a beautiful phone. The new oled display is beautiful, going edge to edge and with a notch at the top. Some may not like the notch, but you get used to it. Apple FINALLY releases wireless charging into an iPhone, so this is nice. The phone has a premium feel with the stainless steel frame, and glass back. Face ID is a nice concept, but I’d rather have a finger print reader on the back. If you place your phone down on a table you’ll find yourself leaning over to get into view for the Face ID to work.

"5222",336,"Smooth phone","As an iPhone user for many years I can say this version is good as most of the upgrades are, the only thing is that most apps still don’t have support for the faceid and loops themselves sometimes & if your life is attached to having a home button you’re going to crazy the 1st weeks trying to get used to it, so overall is good..: expensive but good",5,2018-01-17 17:52:00,"iphoneX"

"5243",357,"Great phone","Good camera quality, overall very satisfied with purchase.",5,2019-07-07 21:48:00,"iphoneX"
"5244",358,"Great iPhone for the new upgrade","I got the black iPhone X and I really love how simple this iPhone is versus the different iPhone X that there are now. Just like the iPhone 8 plus except the face recognition and fullscreen",5,2018-12-05 14:53:00,"iphoneX"
"5245",359,"It's an Iphone","Aside from all the fancy new features and bezeless display, it is an iPhone with IOS11. You can probably get the same features in the iPhome 8 and save a few bucks. The X is a lot smaller than I thought it would be so keep that in mind if you are coming from a larger phone.",4,2017-12-23 16:22:00,"iphoneX"
"5246",360,"New phone","Battery life is good. Phone works great. I washed my last one, bought on Best Buy and picked up later that day. Doesn’t get more easy than that.",5,2019-02-20 21:51:00,"iphoneX"
"5247",361,"great self portrait camera","The portrait feature can now be used for selfies and there’s new filters to go with it. I love the stage lighting filter.

"5248",362,"Beautiful","Got this for my sister in law for her upgrade with AT&T. I always upgrade with bestbuy. They are so much easier to deal with then the actual phone service retail associates. 

We got her the silver and it looks beautiful. I cant stop staring at it.",5,2018-08-08 07:50:00,"iphoneX"
"5249",363,"Great so far","I have only had the phone for about two weeks now. But so far no problems at all. The battery with me using it a lot last’s around 8 hours. That’s with my Apple Watch paired to it also.",5,2018-04-06 12:31:00,"iphoneX"

"5252",366,"Best iPhone yet!","I purchased the iPhone X even though I heard reviews of it not being worth the money. I absolutely love this phone. I love that is is less bulky but you have a larger screen. Fits into wristlets where my iPone 6 Plus did not. The face recognition is one of my favorite features. I don’t miss the button! It was a slight learning curve but I love it!",5,2017-12-30 07:33:00,"iphoneX"

"5259",373,"Easy and friendly to use.","Ive had every iphone that has came out after the 3G , and i mist say “ that i really do love this phone “ !
Especially the face recognition! I no longer have to use my fat large thumb multiple times to get into my phone . Just a simple tap to turn on ,or the phone itself knwoing you picked it up and looking at it . So that it unlocks! I love it !",5,2017-12-23 20:21:00,"iphoneX"

"5261",375,"iPhone X","iPhone X is a wonderful device. It was a bit cumbersome for me to figure out how to do all the other things I used to on my previous iPhones but the Best Buy Mobile staff is the best. They took time to explain all the features I had questions about....and well, candidly, YouTube taught me more stuff. :) Buy iPhone X",5,2018-03-09 16:06:00,"iphoneX"
"5262",376,"Love the camera!","Awesome camera. Love the easiness of the Face ID! Love apple and all its user friendly options!!!",5,2018-11-29 10:35:00,"iphoneX"

"5264",378,"Great. Best iPhone yet.","Bought this for my wife. We’ve owned many iPhones and this one has the best screen by far. The lack of home button is not missed. We’ve done comparisons by playing the same movie at the same time on the iPhone X and a iPhone 7plus and the X’s screen is so much better. The cameras are the best too.",5,2018-04-18 17:36:00,"iphoneX"
"5265",379,"Apple","Love it absolutely love it Apple at its best would definitely recommend it to anyone that is in the Apple do love it better than Android",5,2018-08-17 14:15:00,"iphoneX"
"5266",380,"Nice phone","Iphone X is a nice phone but takes some getting used to with no home button and having to use facial recognition or pass code. Swiping, closing and more are all different so don't expect to pick it up and use it like any other iPhone. Overall im very happy with the size and speed and would buy it again.",5,2018-03-30 21:22:00,"iphoneX"
"5267",381,"Slick and nice large screen","The iPhone X is a choice unit. To match the Samsung, they expanded the screen to cover the whole unit and it's pretty sweet. Resolution is unreal; very crisp and clear. However, it also shows smudges a lot more than the previous models, but that's a small price to pay for an overall nice phone!",5,2018-04-19 08:35:00,"iphoneX"
"5268",382,"Easy to use","I bought this phone to replace my old one and the transaction was very smooth.",5,2019-05-31 16:15:00,"iphoneX"
"5269",383,"Love it","I was very skeptical at first on buying my iPhone X but after having it for a couple weeks, I absolutely love it. I upgraded from an iPhone 6s So this is a big jump for me but highly recommend it for everybody else. If you have an iPhone 7 or 8 do not upgrade. It would seem worthless for you.",5,2018-04-21 19:29:00,"iphoneX"
"5270",384,"Love It","Bought this upgrade for my wife. It has a slight learning curve due to the different/updated features from her previous iPhone, but she loves it!",5,2019-02-09 04:24:00,"iphoneX"
"5271",385,"Very Good","I love my new phone! Upgraded from an iPhone7 so no more home button but now I have to swipe up. It’s all about that swiping game now. Should’ve waited to get the iPhoneXS Max though..",5,2018-11-30 08:40:00,"iphoneX"

"5274",388,"Great device, bit expensive","I bought it for my son going to college. I could have waited a few days to buy the latest version however my son didn’t care for the “improvements” in the newer version. Besides this was cheaper by $100. He loves it.",5,2018-09-28 17:39:00,"iphoneX"
"5275",389,"It’s an iPhone !!! Need I say more","It’s not perfect but then again, it comes pretty close to it. Closer then anyone else. Love it.

"5276",390,"Best phone ever","The IPhone X is my first iPhone having been a longtime Android user. This phone pushed me to switch and I could not be happier.

"5277",391,"Love my Phone!!","This iPhone is wonderful! I love the Face ID and the larger screen. I previously had an iPhone 6 Plus, so the change in the device size is a welcome one. The camera is AH-Mazing! The OLED screen is also a nice feature. Videos show very well. It’s easy to adjust to not having a home button. I don’t miss it at all! I would definitely recommend the purchase!",5,2017-11-10 13:06:00,"iphoneX"
"5278",392,"IphoneX","I have wanted this phone for a long time. Best Buy has a great deal on it so I bought it. I have had 2 iPhones before this one. It is a great phone; love the camera on it!!",5,2018-12-19 17:30:00,"iphoneX"

"5281",395,"Great phone","Great phone to replace my iPhone 6. Love the Face ID, but sometimes miss the finger ID. Much faster than my old phone, and once you get used to how to navigate without the home button, it’s a breeze!",5,2018-10-29 15:55:00,"iphoneX"
"5282",396,"Love my new phone!","Upgrades are always nice! Definitely nice going from a 7 to a X!",5,2019-06-19 03:16:00,"iphoneX"

"5284",398,"Great!","I've really enjoyed this phone since day one. It took about a day for the learning curve without a home button, but now it is second nature. I replaced a Galaxy S8+ that was buggy and crashed all the time. This phone takes great pics, has excellent battery life, and has worked flawlessly without crashing once. Great investment!",5,2018-01-17 17:40:00,"iphoneX"
"5285",399,"So fast and easy to use","I didn’t think it would be any different. I had the iPhone 7Plus and I loved it and didn’t want to leave it, but once I saw how beautiful the iPhone X was I immediately fell in love with its aesthetic features and its size. It’s smaller yet bigger screen.",5,2018-07-06 13:08:00,"iphoneX"
"5286",400,"Best. iPhone I ever owned","This iPhone is the best yet I have owned just about every version of the iphone very few dropped calls but that is because of the service in the area,Verizon is putting up a mini tower in back of my house which I think will stop the dropped calls",5,2018-07-25 07:55:00,"iphoneX"

"5289",403,"Face recognition doesn’t always work","Face recognition doesn’t always work. It’d be much more helpful if the thumbprint option would pop up. Having to type in a password is still a bit of a nuisance, but I appreciate the fact that it still works with sunglasses on. Also, face recognition works in the dark, sometimes. The way to fully close apps takes additional steps versus swiping up on other iPhones. It’s not exactly a smooth transition from the other iphones. Does take a lot of getting used to. Camera quality is great, but I would recommend sticking to the iPhone 8 for the price.",4,2018-02-25 08:30:00,"iphoneX"
"5290",404,"Happy Iphone X owner","At first, I wasn't sure about this product due to the price. But, after doing some research I came to the conclusion that the functionality of this device justifies the price. Once again Apple delivered an excellent product.",5,2018-09-07 14:00:00,"iphoneX"

"5292",406,"Love it!","I have small hands so having the larger phones is hard for me to hold with just one hand. And I can’t be holding my phone with two hands all the time! This phone is a great size compromise for holding and the screen is the winning number! Goes out to the edges!",5,2018-06-20 17:59:00,"iphoneX"
"5293",407,"Glass Protector","I higher recommend the glass protector for your phone. It’s so clear that you can not notice it on the phone but it protects the screen from breaking and it has a lifetime warranty",5,2018-11-30 23:09:00,"iphoneX"
"5294",408,"Great product","Versatile phone equipped with all the features you need to stay connected on the go.",5,2019-05-16 08:17:00,"iphoneX"

"5300",414,"Pleased","I’ve had the phone for a while now and overall it is a good product. Not sure if I like the facial recognition better or the fingerprint recognition from my last phone better. Takes great pictures.",4,2019-05-16 06:23:00,"iphoneX"
"5301",415,"My girlfriend really liked this phone!","My girlfriend thought this phone was light years ahead of her old iPhone 7. It has so many features, she probably won't find all of them by the time she thinks this phone is out of date.",5,2018-11-16 16:10:00,"iphoneX"
"5302",416,"Amazing features","In love with all the new features! Only thing that can be annoying is if you have face id set up and look at the phone after a missed call, it automatically calls them back. Don’t have a single complaint about the phone & so glad they did away with the home button",5,2018-06-08 15:58:00,"iphoneX"

"5304",418,"This iPhone is great!","I’ve been a huge Apple fan for a long time and this by far is one of my favoreites.

As for Face ID, it has definitely grown on me.",5,2018-05-17 02:39:00,"iphoneX"
"5305",419,"iPhone X","So far it’s great except for only having it for less than a week and the face recognition stopped working and I had to get the phone replaced. Other than that I love all the new features it has that the other iPhones don’t.",5,2018-09-01 11:37:00,"iphoneX"
"5306",420,"Amazing phone","Upgraded from the 6 plus and boy am I glad! Fyi, you don’t need to setup Face ID if you don’t want to! You can still do swipe up to unlock and punch in your password and voila! Great alternative for those that don’t like having to set up Face ID and having your face stored somewhere.",5,2018-04-20 16:57:00,"iphoneX"
"5307",421,"Good Phone But Pricey","Ive had an Android phone of over 20 years and the iPhone X is my first Apple phone. Its a bit of a learning curve but I love Apple products in general and expect to love this phone as well as time goes by. The only thing I prefer with the Android phones over the iPhone is the adjustabbility of the main screen (which is really not a big deal). I gave the 4 stars review because I haven't had enough time yet to see all the pros and cons.",4,2018-07-21 11:39:00,"iphoneX"

"5309",423,"Big Screen on a Small Phone","I love the bigger screen of the iPhone X while maintaining the small phone size. The camera is awesome, and the features it offers are great.

"5311",425,"This iPhone X is AMAZING","I wasn't sure I wanted this new phone until I was having trouble with my 7,but the retina scanning is the most amazing this I have seen in a while. It really works well and is so hassle free when it comes to using the phone. This is jus one of the many features I love, the other is the sharpness of the new camera. Well done Apple!",5,2017-12-21 17:27:00,"iphoneX"
"5312",426,"Gift for my girls","Best Buy is the best place to buy phones, the girls love these devices. Very high quality, Apple is always pricey, but they hold there resale value better than any other phone.",5,2018-11-30 13:18:00,"iphoneX"
"5313",427,"Best iPhone to date","I've been an Android guy for nine years waiting for it to be worth it to switch.

"5316",430,"Nice","I want to love this phone, but I've had nothing but problems since the moment I got it. I upgraded from an iPhone 6s. I've had more problems with this brand new X than I did with the old 6s and Apple can't even figure out why!!!!! GRRR....Even Verizon has tried to help. They, Apple, made a couple of stupid changes, but a lot of nice changes as well.",4,2018-11-07 00:58:00,"iphoneX"

"5327",441,"Great Phone","If you have an Iphone you already know the quality. The hype was a little much, it did take a little while to get used to the new screen with no home button, screen gestures and case size (came from a 7+) but got used to it quickly. if you're not sure how something works definitely google and YouTube it.",5,2018-02-15 13:31:00,"iphoneX"

"5329",443,"Love the Portrait Mode","Although my iPhone 6 was 3 years old, I mainly bought this iPhoneX because of the amazing camera features.

"5330",444,"Great phone","Got a great lease deal through sprint, so the upgrade was worth it. Face Id isnt quite as smooth as they make it seem, but still works most if the time. Not sure if I'd upgrade over the 7 or 8 if it was full price, but it is a great phone",5,2018-07-20 16:56:00,"iphoneX"

Most iPhones don't offer a whole lot from generation to generation. This is the first one that feels like it truly evolved. The Face ID is quite cool. I'm still trying to figure out which third-party apps work and which do not. The True Depth camera is amazing and that alone is worth picking up this beauty. The real issue is the price. Not sure if Apple will ever offer a price reduction but paying monthly installments over 2 years is not the worst option to bring this phone home today!",4,2017-12-08 12:29:00,"iphoneX"

When it was ready to be picked up we found that they had just sent her a new phone, that should have been the first warning. Now after owning the phone for a little over 4 months the battery is failing. It shows 100%, but unexpectedly shuts off. When you try to turn it on it says that the battery is low. After plugging it in and the phone turns on it shows that the battery is at 100%...Taking it in (again) to be fixed.

"5989",1103,"Not Too Sure Yet","Im honestly not very impressed with this phone. I was under the impression Apple was designing this phone with the ability to essentially be used as a computer, with connectivity to a keyboard and display. This is not a feature I would use often or is of great importance, but it is innovation and could help support the price of this.

Additionally, why make this in all glass? (Aside from the fact that it will boost accessory sales as well as repair revenue).

This phone still acts glitchy and I got the unlocked version with 256GB memorory. The unlocked version has 4GB of RAM vs the traditional iPhone X models (Carrier Specifict Models). You can research this to confirm if you doubt this is correct.

I am at the point where I might just return the phone and either choose another alternative such as the Google2 phone or the BlackBerry KeyOne.

My life is cluttered enough, sometimes getting back to basics is most important. Especially when the difference in price is $700.00!",3,2017-12-23 14:18:00,"iphoneX"

"6511",1625,"Gimmicky.","So Apple finally decided to redesign the iPhone and this is the result. I give them props for the overall look at the phone as well as finally upgrading the screen technology and adding wireless charging. However the gestures are not intuitive and face ID does not work nearly as well as they say it does unless you disable The required attention feature which makes the phone less secure. With this feature turned on it only works one in every five or six trials for me. It was a massive mistake for them to illuminate touch ID. If they were going to go all screen on the front that’s fine. But they should have put a fingerprint reader on the back of the phone like the rest of the industry.

I don’t see that much improvement on the camera either, supposedly it’s the best camera on a phone but I’ve seen the new Samsung galaxy 9 and the camera there surpasses this one. I wish I would have waited for the Samsung galaxy 9 because if your going to spend this much money on a phone then it should be a phone you should feel happy about purchasing instead of “I wish” I would have waited for the new droid.",3,2018-03-05 11:38:00,"iphoneX"

"7585",2699,"Best iPhone yet","I’ve had almost every iPhone in the past and before this had the iPhone 7 Plus 128gb black. This phone is amazing. The screen is stunning and new features are a nice change. For the first few hours it can be quite a change navigating the new gestures of your a previous iPhone user but you quickly start t adopt to the new gestures quite easily. The sound is much better, wireless charging is a quite usable feature and yes animojis are quite fun. Face ID is great but the extra swipe in the beginning is a little taxing. Hopefully more apps will integrate Face ID from Touch ID as I have had to enter passwords where I previously used Touch ID as that is not an option as of yet. So in conclusion the iPhone X feels like an actual upgrade compared to the past of a few new features not a new phone. It’s defiantly worth the purchase as it is quite enjoyable.",5,2017-11-04 07:19:00,"iphoneX"

"8016",3130,"iPhone X Defect","My iPhone X expierence so far. Preordered on Oct. 27th and managed to get a Gray/Black 256GB Iphone X. Finally arrives on the 6th and I don’t get a chance to open it up and attempt to hook up my new phone until the 11th. So here I go beaming with excitement to check out my new device that just cost me the equivalent of a house payment. Open it up and everything looks good at first and then I use my iPhone 6S light to look at the screen for any dust as I’ve already gotten a screen protector in hand to put on my new device before I even get started. Then I see it. A very very small scratch or crack under the screen coming from the notch area at the top of the phone coming down maybe 1/2 a cm long. So I schedule an appointment to talk to an Apple rep. for 8:45am and he finally calls me at 8:48am. I explain to him what I observed on my phone and he doesn’t seem to thrilled to help me out today. Maybe because it’s a Saturday and he’s at work. During our conversation he makes a statement that I didn’t really care for. Such as... Maybe the delivery man dropped your package and maybe that’s what happened. Obviously this is a manufacturing defect since it’s under the screen. So I get two options. Option A) Send my phone in to be repaired and who knows how long that will take and why would I want a brand new item I just paid a lot of money for to be repaired due to a defect. Option B) Go to the Apple Store and have them look at it and I can try and request a new phone. Oh and the next available time I can get an appointment is 4 days away and I’ll have to take off work early to resolve an Apple manufacturing defect. So I guess we will see how my Apple Store experience goes. I’ve had an Apple phone going back to the 3GS days and I’ve dealt with Apple Customer Service in the past with no issues but so far I’d have to say I’m extremely disappointed in the quality control of the IPhone X and the customer service expierence with Apple.

"8053",1,"Great product for a first time Apple user","I've never owned an Apple product but this year I took the plunge to move from Android (Pixel phones, Samsung phones) to get this iPhone 11. It was the right time for me to do so. With the changes and improves iOS13 brings (from all that I've read and watched in reviews/vids) and the camera upgrades from XR; the transition has been fairly easy. I know there is a learning curve for me as I slowly learn the iOS system. But I changed to have the best of both worlds. And it is true the Google apps in iOS do run better than on Android.

The phone performance has been stellar. NO lag. NO freezes. I had prepared myself to have a smooth experience with iOS, but I have still been surprised and pleased with the fluidity. Never have I experienced anything so smooth on any of the many Android phones I've used over the years. The battery is a superstar champ. It feels as if I cannot kill it if I were to try. Even though I am never far from a charging option, it is so refreshing to not feel battery anxiety.

Siri is WAY better than I was led to believe. In fact I find her to be more responsive and less buggy than Google Assistant - especially when using Apple CarPlay. This was a surprise to me due to all I've read. Voice to text is admittedly not as accurate as Assistant. 

I already knew the iPhone cameras take the best videos, but the updates to the photos themselves are phenomenal. The auto night mode is fantastic - I like it better than Pixel's Night Sight. It seems more natural. True the Portraits are sometimes not as well defined as on the Pixel phones - but that is something that is not a game changer for me. I like the fact that photos on the iPhone 11 are not over sharpened as is true on the Pixel lineup (I've had all 3 Pixel phones so I'm not spinning my wheels here).

True tone is fantastic. The color (mint green) is the prettiest color I've had on a phone. I have no issues with the LCD screen versus OLED - it's a great screen. The gestures are great and smooth and easy to learn. 

I've been so pleased with this that I'm not looking at (researching) buying one of the Macbook laptops (tablets are not for me). 

This is a fantastic phone. No looking back.",5,2019-10-06 11:43:00,"iphone11"

"8057",5,"Amazing pics and footage!","Love my new iPhone 11! It’s fast and the camera is amazing. Video quality is excellent.",5,2020-01-03 16:22:00,"iphone11"
"8058",6,"Great phone for the price","This review is based on upgrading from an iPhone X to an 11, hopefully it helps those who are in the same situation. 
There were a few reasons I chose to upgrade, I wanted a slightly bigger screen, I wanted better battery life, and I wanted better speed (I play quite a bit of games on my phone). I had also made the mistake of getting an X with only 64gb which was a bad idea to begin with. This phone fortunately covers all those issues. The battery life is great and the speed at which this phone opens apps is incredible. The camera with the wide angle is also a big bonus, I’ve never been a big photographer with my phones, but I’ve found myself using this phone a lot more for that purpose.
The one downside to this phone is the quality of the screen, this is more evident with the new dark mode in iOS13. Black screens on this phone aren’t really black, they’re more of a dark grey and this is due to the OLED vs LCD screen.
I still own my X and once I upgraded it to iOS13 I could see the difference in dark mode, on my X the black backgrounds seem truly black while on the 11 the blacks seem a little lighter. Does this make the upgrade not worth it? I guess it depends how much the lighter blacks bother you. Personally, after a month of use I don’t notice it much anymore.
At $749 for the 128gb I would highly recommend this phone, if the LCD screen bothers you that much then I would recommend going for the Pro but at the price point I’m not sure extra deep blacks are worth it.",5,2019-10-21 13:03:00,"iphone11"
"8059",7,"Fantastic upgrade","Upgraded to the 11, 128gb from an 8+ 256gb. Never needed 256 with the 8+ But that was the next size up from 64gb. 128gb is perfect. I’m able to keep all of my photos and all of my music on this phone with 60+gb left. A lot of talk about how the pro screen is so much better than the 11’s LCD screen. But going from the 8+ that already had an LCD, this screen seems sharper and more vibrant. The thing that really stands out is the speed. This thing just flies. I can click a link or open a new app and it loads almost as quickly as snapping your fingers. The camera on the 8+ was already pretty good, but again the 11 shines better here. I love the wide angle lense and the night mode. I used to hate taking low-light pics due to the flash making things seem so white. What I like most is gaining some screen size compared to my 8+, but in a smaller form factor. Overall I am extremely satisfied with my upgrade and would definitely do it again. For most people, the iPhone 11 is the upgrade that is worth every penny!",5,2019-09-22 16:19:00,"iphone11"
"8060",8,"A screen I can see without the bulk of a PLUS","I left a 7 for this 11. It gives me a visual screen that I can see without the bulk of the iPhone 7+ which my husband is very happy with. 

It’s taken a bit to get the hang of it but I had excellent help getting started with the help of Joshua in the mobile department. Later I went back in to my geek Michael who went step by step through the questions that had cropped up. 

If you haven’t used anything past iPhone 8 be sure to play around and make a list of what you’re stuck on. Take it to mobile or geek squad. If it’s easier, call Apple. 

Enjoy your new iPhone!!!

Very important to me is that this phone doesn’t have the OLED screen. I’m extremely light sensitive and get migraines. This is the only phone I can use. If Apple  switches to all OLED screens in the future I’m off iPhone.",5,2019-09-27 15:30:00,"iphone11"

My wife bought the iPhone 11 and I am thinking about switching to it. The camera is AMAZING. Battery life is great and the new iOS adds a lot of shortcuts that apple was missing. For 699 apple hit a home run with this phone. Even tho the screen is lower resolution the colors and brightness are astounding. I'm not an Apple fan but may be...I just haven't switched yet because I still love Android but I'm on the fence.",5,2019-10-13 09:22:00,"iphone11"
"8062",10,"Best iPhone to this day! Right size right price.","The iPhone 11 is an amazing phone. I had a XS Max before, and traded it in to get this, and I am so happy I did. This is what I consider the “Goldilocks” iPhone; it’s just right. The size, both screen and body, is perfect, being in between the 11 Pro and Pro Max. It’s not as good a screen as the Pro’s OLED, but it’s still pretty darn good. The colors are amazing and it still is a very high-definition screen. Why spend extra for a better screen? You’re getting the same processor, which is wicked fast, and ALL the same features as the Pro! I am so glad that I switched from the XS Max because I can enjoy all of the same great features of the Pro model for a fraction of the cost. I would HIGHLY recommend considering buying the 11 over the Pro series.",4,2019-09-29 17:16:00,"iphone11"

"8066",14,"my first iphone","this  is my first iphone, been a samsung owner since the S4 came out, it's a great phone, love how it picks up wifi where ever i am, no signing in to networks. i got the 11 because i'm a photographer, it's all about the camera for me. my 2 issues is the volume, on phone calls i have to put on speaker phone,just to see if i'm connecting with my caller, i'm still learning how to navigate thru out, also the photos are out of order when transferred over, but pairs well with my car.  pros and cons like everything.",5,2020-01-26 11:02:00,"iphone11"
"8067",15,"Amazed","I have had the 8 plus in red for 2 years but I was the  lucky One and got a defective device it didn’t happen after the first year was over and I was debating on the 11 or 11 pro and after finally deciding on the 11 I don’t see much of a difference except a little more screen and extra camera but I love my red iPhone 11 best decision and of course Best Buy is the way to go when starting a contract or upgrading they always look for deals and with a lower phone payment",5,2019-12-06 15:35:00,"iphone11"
"8068",16,"Good Phone","I was impressed by how well the content transferred from my old Iphone to the new one, it even captured my folders on the screen and the open internet windows I had.  I stayed onsite at Best Buy and they helped me get things going.  They also price matched a phone case for me which saved me time and energy ordering it from elsewhere. 

the only struggle I had was transferring my applewatch content to the new phone, my husband had to back it up on a desktop and reset some things before the apple watch would recognize the new phone.",5,2020-01-03 16:15:00,"iphone11"
"8069",17,"Terrific phone","I’m totally impressed with this new I-phone 11. I was a dedicated Blackberry owner for 20 years! Now I’m wondering what took me so long to switch. At 72 years old I have mastered iOS 13 in a little more than one day! It is so incredibly friendly. I love it.",5,2019-09-27 15:24:00,"iphone11"
"8070",18,"So many reasons this was a great gift","My son had issues with his old phone and the thought of not being able to get a hold of each other at any time was upsetting to both of us. His old phone likely could have been repaired, but there was no guarantee. It made sense to buy a new phone and know that he not only had something reliable, but also something that had better features and more storage than his previous phone. He loved it and I love knowing that he appreciates the new phone as well.",5,2020-01-18 14:44:00,"iphone11"
"8071",19,"Impressive New Version of the iPhone","I had been using an iPhone 6s for several years but was having issues with battery life, the charging port, etc. so I decided it was time to update. I debated buying an older model rather than the iPhone 11 to avoid the use of Face ID but decided to go with the most recent model and think that was the right decision. The battery life is fantastic in comparison to my old phone, the picture quality is great and I am enjoying the slightly larger screen. I have still not turned on Face ID but may do so eventually which reduces the ease of use somewhat in comparison to the old thumbprint ID.",4,2020-01-03 16:37:00,"iphone11"
"8072",20,"Great new phone","I’m still getting used to my new iPhone 11 because it’s quite a bit different from my iPhone 6S Plus. I loved that phone but am starting to love my new iPhone 11 as well. I really like the red color to start with, but also all the new features, such as face recognition, swiping from one screen to the next & the camera takes really clear & pretty photos. There are many other options that I’m still learning, but overall I really like my new phone & would highly recommend it.",5,2020-01-10 16:36:00,"iphone11"
"8073",21,"Nice upgrade!","I've had an Apple 6+ iPhone for years and finally decided to purchase an upgrade to iPhone 11.  It's a really nice phone and the new features are cool. I wish these phones weren't so expensive but the quality and security this phone provides helps offset the price for me. I also have a MacBook Pro, so I like that I have 2 Apple products that are easy to sync.",5,2020-02-07 16:20:00,"iphone11"
"8074",22,"Pretty big compared to iPhone 6","I upgraded from an iPhone 6 to this iPhone 11 which is much larger, does not have the ""button"" to push on the screen (now need to swipe right) and does not allow charging and use of headphones at the same time - both use the same port.  Definitely something to get used to.  Some of my App. passwords transferred over, some did not.  I'm still not sure what the difference is in having 2 cameras instead of one.  Learning curve.",5,2020-01-07 17:15:00,"iphone11"
"8075",23,"Best iPhone ever!","I moved up from an SE. What a difference!  Facial id makes sign on a breeze. You pick up the phone, look at it and boom you are in. Swoop up and there are your apps. Swoop up again to leave an app. 

Sound is good quality. I haven’t used the headphones so I can’t comment. 

This is the 64 gig model. The case is actually as large as the pro.",5,2020-02-01 00:42:00,"iphone11"
"8076",24,"Real Nice Upgrade!","Upgrading from a 6, this baby really is nice. Battery life is about twice as long, even after taking advantage of battery replacement on my old 6. Processing speed is astounding, app upgrades are super short. Display is large, bright and sharp. Size was more than I wanted, but it still fits in my front pocket. I thought the loss of the home button was going to be problematic, but in a few hours of use I was completely comfortable with swiping up. So much so that I get somewhat lost when I have to use my wife’s 7. The camera is much more capable than I need but I’m finding new uses as I discover features. The only downside is they didn’t give it to me for free!",5,2019-10-18 20:48:00,"iphone11"
"8077",25,"Switched from Android to IOS","I am new to an Apple IOS phone. There is a slight learning curve for a first time purchaser of an Apple product. I like the phone but, there are a few features I dislike. 1. I don't like that if I am away from my phone and receive a text message or phone call I have no way of knowing I have received either because, there isn't a light that will blink to let me know I have missed either. 2. I don't care for the camera to much. I don't see options to change my pictures such as, low lighting mode, panorama, and others I can't think of right now. 3. I don't like that I can not use some apps that I could on my android. 4. I don't like that I have to turn WiFi off each day from the top right corner pull down. Then it tells me it will turn it off until the next day and each day I have to go through that to turn it off.  If I go into settings and turn it off there, I am not able to use my hot spot. For it to be an Apple 11 (yes I know it's not the pro or pro max) you would think it would have more features. However, as I said I am new to Apple and it could just be that I have not figured things out.",4,2019-11-05 16:05:00,"iphone11"
"8078",26,"Impressive New Version of the iPhone","Bought this for my wife who had been using an iPhone 6s for several years but was having issues with battery life and fuzzy pictures so I decided it was time to update. I debated buying an older model for her rather than the iPhone 11 to avoid the use of Face ID but decided to go with the most recent model and think that was the right decision. The battery life is fantastic in comparison to her old phone, the picture quality is great and she is enjoying the slightly larger screen. She has been using Face ID but has not been thrilled with the functionality in comparison to the old thumbprint ID. She is also having to replace her phone holders due to the larger size.",4,2020-01-06 15:44:00,"iphone11"
"8079",27,"Flawless","Lightning fast processor. My emails, reports, PDFs, app updates, everything! downloads so quickly. There is nearly zero wait time for apps that I have had to wait between 30 seconds and 2 minutes for my XR that I traded in.

Camera: the HD features of the 11 are pretty much useless if your subject is farther than 8 feet away. Also, depending on the angle of capture, faces of people can appear slanted or warped if they are on the edge of the shot; I understand this is hard to escape, due to the tiny lens creating a “walleye vision” effect just from the light passing through it. Physics is still unarguable, despite our digital prowess.",5,2019-10-21 08:56:00,"iphone11"
"8080",28,"So far so good","I went from an Android to an IPhone this time around. I was hoping the battery life would be better but not so much. It is a work in progress getting used to the difference in operating systems. The camera is good not much difference my my old phone. Over all pretty good.",4,2019-09-28 06:36:00,"iphone11"
"8081",29,"Big upgrade from my wife's SE","All works well. Pro tip, take the plastic screen protector from the factory off before trying to call or you and the person you're talking to will be frustrated. All works well, iOS transfer is great for mirroring devices. Camera was actually less clear than expected. Shots seem very grainy and not high quality when sending to other devices with higher resolution screens.",5,2020-01-03 16:48:00,"iphone11"
"8082",30,"iPhone 11 is a great phone.","I was cautioned before buying it about it not having a ""home"" button. It took me all of two minutes to get used to using the phone without one.  I like everything about this phone.",5,2020-02-28 18:09:00,"iphone11"
"8083",31,"Second time was the charm","Got an iPhone 11 on Black Friday and for the first time ever in my Apple buying experience, the phone wouldn't work. It couldn't connect for some reason. After the great help at Best Buy, I was given this phone and it's been great ever since. Getting to know the new functions was pretty easy after having a 7 for so long. 

Great phone for a great cause.",5,2019-12-22 11:10:00,"iphone11"
"8084",32,"This is a very good phone.","My husband and I both bought one of these iPhone 11 phones. I thought this was a vast improvement over my iPhone 7. It seems to be a very easy to work with phone, now I just have to get used to IOS 13. I wish to commend both Terrell and Adrienne for the great jobs they did for us at the Verizon desk. I think they are a great asset for the Best Buy store in Mishawaka Indiana store.",5,2019-10-01 08:15:00,"iphone11"
"8085",33,"The sweet spot in the iPhone line up","I, like another reviewer, traded in an iPhone XS Max for the iPhone 11. No regrets! I like the size better, it has a brilliant screen, and saves me $15.00/month on my phone bill. I still have the features of the Pro series that matter to me and paying $400 less for it. All iPhones are great phones and I wouldn’t own anything else but for me the 11 hits all the marks for my needs at a reasonable price. If you’re on the fence about upgrading to the iPhone 11, go for it! You won’t regret it. It’s a great device!",5,2019-10-25 17:49:00,"iphone11"

Highly recommend Best Buy for all your wireless needs.",5,2020-01-04 10:40:00,"iphone11"
"8088",36,"Great batter life!","This is my first iPhone and I love it so far. The battery life is much better than my google pixel.

I took a video in 4k, but I cannot watch it in 4k on the phone, a little strange, but OK.  Battery life is FANTASTIC.  The screen is bright.  Having a hard time with the sounds, either too loud or cannot hear it. But I like the phone, like IOS 13 and like the dual speakers on the bottom.",5,2019-11-12 09:42:00,"iphone11"
"8091",39,"I switched to the dark side","I am not a fan of apple.  However all of my kids have iphones and I was missing out on the interconnectivity that iphones have.  I have to admit that this phone has changed my mind about iPhones.  It wasn't as painful of a switch as I thought it would be.  This is a really nice phone and takes great pictures.",5,2019-12-29 00:19:00,"iphone11"
"8092",40,"Rough start but a great phone","I had some issues, probably from the IOS 13 bugs restoring this phone from a backup. It froze up, shut down and would not power on. After a visit to BB a tech got it back up running using vol up, vol down and power button combo unfroze the phone. After a couple of IOS 13 updates it works fine. Battery life is incredible! All day of sometime heavy use without a mid day boost. Love the wireless charging, but Apple should throw in a wireless charger rather than making us buy one separately. I huge update from my old iPhone 7.",5,2019-10-11 20:38:00,"iphone11"
"8093",41,"Still getting used to it","This phone replaced an iPhone 5 that was 6 1/2 years old.  I loved that smaller phone, but the battery was just getting weird.  I would lose 80% of my charge in just five minutes.  This phone probably has way more features than I will ever use.  I'm still getting used to swiping it, instead of hitting a home key.  Sadly, it no longer fits into ""pockets"" in my Baggalini purse, so now it's just in the main compartment.  Therefore, I bought a screen protector because I think it's more vulnerable now.  I also wasn't used to the fact that it turns on automatically whenever you touch it.  I was worried I would wear down the charge.  But I do see the benefit of being able to check the time without clicking anything.    The overall huge benefit is that, since I don't use it much, I don't even have to charge it once a day!  I guess it was just time to say goodbye to my trusty 5!  :-(",4,2019-10-24 13:47:00,"iphone11"
"8094",42,"Holy Camera","The cameras on the new iPhone 11 is fantastic. Battery life is substantially better than the iPhone X and the speed of apps to launch is in milliseconds. Quite impressed with this update and would recommend to anyone considering upgrading.",5,2019-09-27 17:21:00,"iphone11"
"8095",43,"Excellent upgrade","This was purchased as a gift for someone upgrading from an iPhone SE so the difference in quality was immediately noticed.

YouTube reviewers had shown the same images taken with both an XR and 11 and the position of the photo images made the focus more in the middle whereas the XR would change the angle a tiny bit to where certain objects being focused on were angled wrong. Sorry for saying the word angle so much, I’m just not good at describing this stuff. I would recommend you watch all of the YouTube videos comparing the newer iPhone models. This phone has night vision to enable Face ID in the dark. Whereas my 2018 iPad Pro cannot read my face in the dark. I don’t know what else to say, except that you should read every review and watch every review you can to decide on which iPhone is best for you. This phone is the cheapest iPhone that came out in 2019 but that doesn’t mean it’s bad. I love this phone very much. It has a really good battery life and standby time. Much better than my 7 which by the way I had the battery for that phone replaced and restored to 100% battery health a week before buying this and that battery sucks in comparison to this one even with the 100% restore. So yeah I’m happy with my phone. Also I use my phone mainly for music and I can listen with my AirPods all day and my phone will be at 40 something percent when the day is almost over. I know my grammar is bad. I just want people to know that this is a good phone",5,2020-01-24 18:04:00,"iphone11"

"8731",679,"Great phone with real all day battery","I upgraded to this phone from an iPhone 6s and it is a huge improvement. On the second battery in my 6s the phone would die after a few hours of moderate use. With the 11 after a full day(12+hours) of moderate to heavy use I have yet to put the battery lower than 35%. I much prefer Face ID over Touch ID and it is almost instantaneous. I compared the screen side by side to the Pro and besides the blacks being slightly blacker the resolution difference is not that apparent to me for everyday use. Cameras and photo processing are excellent. If you like the iPhone ecosystem then this is a great phone.",5,2019-10-18 17:14:00,"iphone11"

"8733",681,"Hate it","Bought this phone after loving my previous 2 iphones, 6s+ and 8s+. Absolutely HATE it. I bought it the day before leaving the country for 3 weeks and missed the return window. Face ID sucks. Screen is ""larger"" but it feels smaller since my hand is blocking part of it most of the time. Screen was very easily scratched compared to my last 2 iphones they definitely changed something there. Never even needed a protector and a few weeks with this it looks terrible. 

To boot I specifically asked the salesman if I would be able to use the phone overseas since I was flying out the next day and since I was paying for the phone in full he said yes no problem, but Verizon locks ALL devices for 60 days so there's nothing I could do. I was basically without a phone for 3 weeks unless on wifi and still missed the return window. Wish I never bought it.",1,2019-12-30 13:01:00,"iphone11"

It automatically downloaded all the apps from my old phone, saving me hours of time!  Love the new cameras!  Love the new colors!  Of course I selected my favorite:  purple!  The only issue I had with the phone resolved itself:  I could not hear calls unless I placed it in speaker mode, a minor-ish issue.

"8770",718,"Love the color and the battery life","I've always eyed red version iPhones but I never really liked any of them and XR, while looking the color I wanted, was not the specs I wanted. But with this 11, I was finally able to let go of my iPhone X and move on. The display compared to iPhone X is different, and maybe it's inferior to some people, but to me it doesn't seem inferior as I can do everything I normally do on the phone okay. If you need color accurate phone to do photo or video editing, then it's not the phone you need, but then again, if you need to do it that badly you probably have a tablet or laptop for that.

Also, the battery life has been amazing. I sometimes forget to charge my phone overnight and with the 11, that is ok.

Now I did want the pro max but I just couldn’t see spending so much monthly on the phone. I’ve had this phone for two weeks and the battery is great, camera awesome and it’s fast.

"8786",734,"Worth every penny!","I am a HUGE audiobook fan and have gone thru countless pairs of headphones including several of the “True Wireless” style.
I LOVES the ease of using only headphone with the TWS style and had already bought about 5 pair through the year because each pair would inevitably fall apart months after purchasing - but nonetheless I was committed to finding the perfect pair of TWs headphones! In fact so committed I had developed serious damage to my ears from wearing the ill-fitting contraptions!
After a recent doctor visit, I learned that I had double ear infections on account of those TWS headphones, so I had the green light from the hubs to spend whatever amount just so I’d stop talking about it AND because obviously “I needed them ;)”.

With that background in mind, the sound and fit of these are absolutely right on! Not once have my ears been the slightest bit tender and since wearing them I have regained all the hearing back in both ears I hadn’t realized I had lost until now.

Hey Siri also works how we wished it had for the last 10 years which is to say she basically just worked how she was supppsdd to.’this feature ended up being the one I was most surprised with because I didn’t really have much hope I’d ever use Siri like I do Alexa but I was wrong !",5,2019-11-23 04:55:00,"iphone11"

If you don't mind paying the Apple tax this is a great product that should meet all your cell phone needs.

I like that it is a bit smaller, fits in small back pockets easier.
I think this is the perfect upgrade for those that want a good phone that takes good pictures and video at a reasonable price.

My iPhone 6s Plus battery and the phone were just starting to slow down so I decided to buy a newer phone. Just like all cell phones they all run great and fast as expected when you first buy them. I do like the wireless charging feature because constantly plugging in and unplugging the phone from the charging port will eventually damage it just like it did on my iPhone 6S plus. The camera is definitely a lot better.",4,2019-12-06 17:18:00,"iphone11"

"8862",810,"Very happy - switched from Android","I've been very happy with my new iPhone 11.  Was a long time Android user but just switched to be compatible with my kids.  Pleasantly surprised that I like it as much as I do.

Also, no one in sales/support (Verizon, Apple, Best Buy) seemed to know the answers on how seamless the process would be to continue using Google Products (Gmail/Contacts/Calendar) from the Android ecosystem on the iPhone.  Many told me that I could import my data into Apple apps but not maintain both databases concurrently.  I am happy to say that this is WRONG.
  
In the Apple Calendar and Apple Contacts, within app settings, you can set your default calendar/contacts account  to be your Google based accounts.  I also loaded the Google Calendar app so the interface is familiar, but I have it sync to the Apple Calendar app so that I can see calendar events in Apple Car Play and use Siri to make new appointments on the fly.   

Gmail app is fine on Android.  I do not use the Apple Mail app. 

So, I have the best of both Apple and Google worlds!!

Phone is fast, features are wonderful.  Love the face ID for unlock, though it doesn't know me with wet hair and without glasses.  Otherwise it works well.  Battery life is AMAZING!!

Obviously, I’m not on my phone a lot,but I wasn’t getting anywhere close to that with my LG V20 with a new battery. The switch over to apple os was pretty minor.

"8942",890,"Making the change from android...","I've used iOS before, but am coming back to Apple from 4 years of Android. Reason--one word: facetime. It just works so well (at least in my experience). A number of other features are similar considerations. Android is very interesting and can be tweaked, but Apple just works. 

The battery life on the 11 is incredible. With moderate use, you can go at least 2 days between charges. My aging Samsung wasn't even making it a full day. I wonder if that's because of the quick-charge feature.

So far, so good.",5,2019-12-16 11:58:00,"iphone11"

"8947",895,"Apple is Apple, always a great product!","Apple products are fabulous products especially for non-tech kind of people. 
The phone is very user friendly. Major difference is there is no home button so you get use to lifting the phone to come on and swilling to get to other apps.",5,2020-02-19 17:49:00,"iphone11"
"8948",896,"Love it","I’m enjoying my new phone however the hype about having the two Cameras is not all that, in my opinion. I will say the photo quality and clarity is outstanding. Perhaps if I

"8949",897,"Best apple ever!","Can’t believe I waited so long to upgrade.  The  iPhone 11 is absolutely  awesome.   This is my 3rd iPhone and I’ve never been disappointed.

If you are thinking of upgrading do yourself a favor and get the iPhone 11.",5,2020-01-10 19:17:00,"iphone11"
"8950",898,"Great phone and great camera!","I normally take horrible pictures, but no more! The wide lens is amazing! The night mode automatically adjusts the lighting to create a great photo.

"8952",900,"Easy to manipulate and move between functions!","I love the size of the 11. I have avoided the larger products because I like to be able to text 1-handed if needed and the smaller screen was adequate for my purposes. The face recognition is quick and the lack of the home button is not the adjustment I expected.",5,2020-01-16 16:33:00,"iphone11"
"8953",901,"Has great screen quality, the camera is the bom","This is my first time with an apple phone and I Love it. The service and overall quality is the bomb.

"8956",904,"Good phone","I was excited to finally get a new phone after having a iPhone 6 for several years. The camera is amazing and the features with the camera are great. There has been issues with echo during calls. Other than that the size is good and the base memory is more than enough for me.",4,2020-02-25 19:32:00,"iphone11"
"8957",905,"Great Phone, but I kinda wish it were smaller","I appreciate the bells and whistles of new iOS and improved battery life as I moved on from iPhone 6, but the new size and weight takes some getting used to. My new holsters make it even more difficult to access my front pants pockets and add even more weight to the phone. That said, everything else about the phone is great--larger capacity--64gb from 16gb = much more music capacity; and it probably is better for my old eyes. I thought I'd miss the Touch ID button, but Face ID actually does work quicker…If I weren't so cheap, I'd probably had gone for the 11 pro!",4,2019-12-13 17:16:00,"iphone11"

I bought my phone on release day and just 16 days later it started randomly showing a blank screen with only a apple log and it would do this for hours the first time it did this I was actually downtown New Orleans with my small children and it made it to where we literally ended up completely lost and in the ghetto we couldn't call for help even if we wanted to which put me and my kids lives in danger which isn't acceptable! I also work solely from my phone and because of this I have lost contracts as well as not been able to go to work when bringing this up to an apple supervisor I was told me saying  that this phone has caused huge issues including putting my kids and I in a dangerous situations and putting my lively hood in danger was offensive to her and that maybe I should travel with a map and find a different job and then she Hung up on me!!",1,2019-10-06 20:37:00,"iphone11"

"9228",1176,"Order cancelled!","I ordered 2 iphone 11s on cyber Monday when many companies offered an excellent discount. Phones were not available and I received messages that they were on backorder. The next day I received an email that my order would be cancelled if not fulfilled by Jan 3. Two days later I received an email that my order was cancelled. I lost out",1,2019-12-27 17:48:00,"iphone11"
"9229",1177,"Buyer Beware","Multiple hardware and software issues; one of the major issues is echoing and feedback that callers hear on their end when I use speakerphone, facetime or bluetooth.  

Apple replaced it once and the replacement has the same issues.  Several trips to genius bar and multiple phone conversations with tech support just to find out that the replacement needs to replaced.  So this phone is great for pictures, just not for making phone calls!

I've saved money for a year to upgrade to iphone 11 and now I am back to using my 6s. 

Others are having the same issue and more information can be found on apple forums at the link below, however apple doesn't seem to want to address the problem.

Love the night mode on the camera and the new purple color (although I wish it was a little darker). I also Really Love that there’s an option to have numbers that are Not in your contacts, that you’re not familiar with Not Ring At All. They will go straight to voicemail.

The phone seems to be a little faster than my iPhone 7. I love the facial recognition feature which basically makes the phone seem to be ready to use as soon as you pick it up.

It wouldn’t connect to my car or 2 wireless earbuds. I tried at least 100x lol. I came back to Best Buy and the guy entered the numbers from my phone’s box (into his computer) then all of the sudden my Bluetooth worked flawlessly. Although, it was very strange and I was never told what they had done, my iPhone now works with Bluetooth perfectly. No other issues at all!",5,2019-10-14 01:02:00,"iphone11"

"9251",20,"Good value for the money","I bought the 11 to replace my iPhone 6, which was using up battery life too soon and too frequently.  In that respect alone, of course, the 11 has proved a great choice.  I did not need the extra bells and whistles of the 11Pro or Max, since I do not take a lot of pictures.  The other greatly expanded features of the 11 (especially compared to my 6!) have proven quite useful, even though I have not explored the whole suite of functions.  Actually, some of the features are a little less than desirable, such as the dropout of volume on certain alerts (?) after the first few seconds, but maybe I just need to read more carefully the settings menus.  I was also quite pleased at the price.",4,2019-11-15 13:50:00,"iphone11"
"9252",21,"Great Upgrade from iPhone 6s","This has been a great upgrade from the iPhone 6s I had.  The staff easily and quickly got me up and rolling converting everything over from my old phone.

Name your new iPhone the exact same Apple ID that on your Apple account page. Or the same ID as your Apple iCloud ID. Then your current Apple computer or iPad and Time Machine, devices, Face Time, the App Store Apple ID, will all be synchronized. Fluid transfer of apps like music, books, Apple TV, podcasts, calendar and more will be interlinked. iPhone's Face ID makes access to keychain simple, fast and secure for website sign-on and banking and Apple pay. The phone allows you to control all aspects of privacy with Siri, advertising, the location from your iPhone settings. So the software and hardware are stable, private and free from third-party intrusion.

Siri can turn any ebook into an audiobook and read the web too.
Dictate text messages amidst background noise with no interference. Delay composing your words and Siri waits without picking up any background noise or turning off.

 The iPhone webpage may be set to reader view with enlarged letters that automatically reformat to your screen for easy reading without manually having to enlarge the print and scroll right and left to read the fine print. 

Apps are quick to download within a second or two. The touchpad is sensitive but not overly sensitive. The only negative is that my 256 GB phone seems to keep apps running in the background, which brings you exactly back where you left off but maybe uses up battery life.

From my experience, the two are almost completely identical, and a normal user won’t even notice the difference. The only drawbacks of the 11 are the lack of that third lens on the camera and the LCD screen vs the OLED. With regard to the telephoto lens, I hardly found myself zooming in far enough to notice not having it. As for the LCD, it is of course a lower resolution than the Pro, and while I do concede that the screen on the Pro is better, it is not a drastic difference. The typical user won’t notice.

It has give n me zero problems *thus far*, everything runs so much smoother, cleaner, and without any errors or apps breaking.

My only annoyance now though (and that goes for all technology, I suppose), are the privacy issues that plaque phones and such when we first buy them. Especially when adults don't know what to do or say when being asked for ""their location"", data, etc. 

I just wish the settings for our Privacy always stayed the same when transferring from phone to phone. Otherwise, I feel like certain generations are being as asked a lot of questions when starting up with a new refresher phone.

What I like better - 
Face ID is better than finger print ID. I didn’t think I would like it but I do. Low light is sometimes a problem but it usually works.

The screen is bigger even tho the device is smaller overall

The front camera is much better. The back camera is better but I’m no professional So I can’t justify why. 

The battery life seems about the same as when I first got the 7 plus, I can usually get a day and a half to 2 days, which is plenty good to me. 

There’s plenty of other specs that are improved but I’m not sure i take full advantage of them in my regular usage.",5,2019-10-25 13:27:00,"iphone11"

"9915",6,"Best iPhone","I originally Purchased the 11 Pro Max. It’s a great phone, but I started noticing it was giving me nasty headache through the day. No matter the brightness. I ended up finding out that since they’re using OLED screen in the 11 pros, it exhibits a phenomenon called PWM. You can research it. Not everyone is effected, but I am. And I had to return it. 

With that out of the way, I can tell you how much I love my 11! It’s got a traditional LCD screen that looks great, and has all of the important stuff the pro’s have. AND it’s cheaper. WAY cheaper. 

Only issue I have is getting used to holding it. I’ve been using iPhone Plus models for years, so going to something more narrow will take some adjusting. 

Otherwise, epic device really.",5,2019-11-30 23:25:00,"iphone11"
"9916",7,"I phone 11 review","I have to say that i was a android man and was not found of I phones, ever since i heard of them getting sued for there phones. Which was something I didn’t want to be in the middle of. I felt like a customer that Purchase one of the phones will be caught paying a price later on. Its just my opinion for any one trying to use what Im saying down the line and it just might of been a excuse I made up not to spend that kind of money on a phone. I have changed my mind on the whole I phone view and I’m glad I purchased one but whats even better that I got it from best buy. I always seen and experience best buy to stand behind their product they sell or promote.   So I believe in best buy and know that no matter who made the product they still make it right with you to the best of their knowledge. I mean they are great and helpful especially during the holidays. I purchased a playstation from during Christmas and I thought that since it was a lot of people that I would have to assist my self but that was not the case. Also any time they had to look up something on my account, they where their like if I didn’t have to explain my self to be understood on what I wanted.

~2 great new cameras- 5

~Battery-life improved greatly- 5
~Size of phone (bigger than in the past)- 3
~Speed (how fast things load)-5
~Price-5 (very well priced)
~No home button- 4 (more screen now)

Overall Rating- 4

The iPhone 11 is reasonably priced, has a great battery life, and the speed is faster than ever. With no home button, there is more screen to do the things you love! One downfall, in my opinion, is the size. The iPhone 11 is much larger than the iPhone X. It is also a lot heavier, which can be a burden in your pocket.

I was a bit skeptic about not having a home button when I upgraded from a 7+, but I have been pleasantly surprised at how easy and intuitive the interface is... again! Last time I got 256GB and never used even nearly half of the space, so this time I went with 128GB, and it has been plenty of storage for me. The battery lasts much longer than my 7+ ever did. I use my phone for business, and I have not yet once had to plug it in before I go to bed at night, and frequently I don't have to plug it in overnight. Price point is my biggest gripe, but I got it from Best Buy at a discount, so it wasn't as bad as I feared. I definitely recommend the iPhone 11.",5,2020-01-16 12:29:00,"iphone11"
"10485",576,"Surprisingly Worthy Upgrade from my iPhone XR","First off, I really loved my XR. I liked the screen size, how powerful the processor was, and the battery life. Contrary to what some people have said, the screen quality on the XR was more than adequate, and my previous phone was the X which has an OLED screen. I even found the camera quality on my XR more than adequate. 

I will say the only substantial difference between the 11 and the XR is the camera. The speaker quality is somewhat clearer with more depth than the XR, but the speakers on the XR are really good and the difference is minor at best. The same is also true for the battery life. The battery life on the XR is great with the 11 slightly greater (with both phones it's unusual for me to have less than 50% battery life at the end of a long day).

Having said all of this, the new cameras are so good it's worth the upgrade from the XR to the 11. I love the night mode and the ultra wide lens. I'm able to take any number of photos I really couldn't take on any iPhone before. But beyond that, the video quality and still life quality on the standard wide lens is the biggest jump I've seen in any iPhone since the iPhone 6 came out. This isn't the sort of upgrade anyone with an iPhone 8 or maybe even iPhone 7 needs, but it's nevertheless a terrific upgrade I am happy I made.",5,2019-11-23 00:20:00,"iphone11"

The signal reception is an absolute joke ever since they switched to Intel. Granted, I do live in the country, but my Galaxy s10e has none of the same signal issues here. VoLTE on the iPhone 11 simply doesn't work unless you're in a super strong signal area, and the signal continuously drops in and out at my house. The amsung Galaxy s10e gets full bars and I have zero trouble talking over VoLTE, at the same location.

The iPhone 11 is a beautiful phone with a long lasting battery and great camera.  My only con is the size - it is significantly larger that my old one and it appears to be very fragile.  My fear is it falling out of a shallow pocket (don't want to add a case due to its size), so I got roped into the Apple Care.  I also like the 128K to store music and photos.

I would certainly recommend this phone to someone looking to upgrade.  The Apple ecosystem is excellent!

We had this picked up at Best Buy, and they also helped with the setup of the new phone.  The staff were great and very helpful.
