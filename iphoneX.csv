"1","Very happy so far","Have spent a few days with the device. It is definitely pricey, but from the user experience point of view, I am pretty happy with the device so far. Here are a few things:

1, The Face ID works well 99% of the time. Pretty responsive, too. For those with glasses I would suggest capture the FaceID with glasses off. 

2, I like its front camera portrait mode. Could take much better selfies. The stage lighting portrait effect could use some improvement, though. The rear camera works better than the 8plus/7plus in low light situations, and generally provides greater contrast and details. 

3, The size is just right. I feel the 8plus is too big, but this one is just about right. I do prefer the size if used without a case, but there's no way I am doing that. The phone has a sleek look and nice finish. Stainless steel frame gives it some extra shine. 

4, It definitely needs a case to protect its fragile glass back. 

5, the wireless charging is a plus. But it charges rather slowly, since I mostly use the iPad USB charger. 

6, the OLED screen is gorgeous. Better images all together. Apple says it helps save battery life. I will see about that. 

Verdict: if you are on the fence between 8Plus/8 and X and have the extra budget to spare, go with the X.",5,2017-11-06 22:54:00
"2","Great phone!! My first IPhone","This was my first IPhone purchase and I have really enjoyed it. I still think the galaxy camera is better. I have seen them side by side at a concert and the galaxy performed much better especially with low light and stage light changes.",5,2019-11-29 16:24:00
"3","Cool phone for avid users","Great battery life and the most advanced camera I’ve used on a art phone. I use a lot of professional cameras (Canon, RED, etc.) and this phone has one that is perfect if i don’t want to lug around a big DSLR!",5,2018-08-10 12:58:00

It has an outstanding camera and the processor speed is the best I’ve ever seen.",5,2019-01-17 06:19:00
"7","What a great phone!","I am currently using my new iPhone X to write this review!! This phone is amazing! The screen is bigger but the phone is not that bulky which is + for me ! The camera is a a total success! Thanks apple!",5,2017-11-17 08:01:00
"8","Is a nice phone","It tak a lot of time to unblock the phone and you literally have to steering at the phone 
I think finger security was 10 tim s better",3,2018-07-27 17:24:00
"9","Solid option","I’ve been using this phone for a little over 2 weeks now and finally feel ready to review it. First, if you’re familiar with iPhones you will have to go through a learning curve to get used to the changes in how you’ll need to use gestures to do what you’ve been used to doing before now. Don’t worry though...you adjust quicker than you can imagine and will find yourself “forgetting” how to do things the old way when you pick up an older iPhone afterwards lol.

 Losing the home button is not as traumatic as some seem to think. Face ID is fast and has been pretty spot on for me. Coming from a Plus model will take some time to adjust to. You will feel like the phone is significantly smaller. You’re right to a certain degree. The extra body you’re used to with the top and bottom bezels make you feel like you’re downsizing but you have to remember that the X screen is bigger (technically) so you’re mainly just loosing the extra none usable space (other than the home button since that was absolutely usable). The X screen is longer but slightly less wide the Plus models. As apps slowly start to update and utilize the full screen your experience gets better. Until then some people will complain and want to bail on the X after just a little handling time. Ultimately you’ll have to handle it and see what your patience level is to see if this phone will work for you. 

The notch...its heavily debated and will bug some people. Again, it’s something you have to gauge for yourself because what bothers you may not bother me (I don’t mind the notch or the size for example). 

Camera is great as always. Some features are more gimmicky than others (Animoji for example is entertaining but not something I’ll likely use much) but as with every phone on the planet some things are just fun perks that may or may not be used. 

The glass...has some people extremely nervous. The answer for that is pretty simple...invest in a case if you’re concerned. I personally almost always use a case so it doesn’t bother me. I didn’t have a case for the better part of the past 2 weeks, dropped my phone a couple of times, but didn’t experience any cracks or anything. But I’m generally careful with my devices so I’ve never experienced a crack (knock on wood). I would suggest investing in AppleCare or insurance if you’re worried about repairs though because the cost is more expensive than ever (check the Apple website for info). Again, that’s a judgement call. It’s not a requirement but if you know you tend to be rough on your devices and don’t want to have to pay expensive repair fees you would benefit from getting AppleCare or some other coverage. 

Ultimately, I truly enjoy my upgrade to the X. No issues so far. The size is great to me but yes, it took some time to get used to. The gestures are super easy. And Face ID has been more accurate than Touch ID for me (not that Touch ID was a problem. It just had issues registering my fingerprint at least twice a day. FaceID has only failed me if my eyes weren’t open or if the phone isn’t able to see my face because of where I am when it tries to scan me). But overall I enjoy the X and think it was a perfect upgrade for me.",5,2017-12-08 17:32:00
"10","It doesn't get better!","This is the best phone I have ever owned! I just switched from Android to iPhone. One thing that kept me from switching is that I never did like iPhone's physical home button. The iPhone X changed that. Honestly, I purchased this phone for the high quality camera. I sold a bunch of pro camera gear to buy it. Not only is the camera amazing, with a lot of features I've never even knew existed, the phone just plain & simply operates so smoothly. 
Pros: amazing camera, fluid like operation, everything just makes sense, phone is fast, screen auto adjusts to lighting conditions, dual speakers, phone call quality is fantastic, the colors are amazing, I liked how in case of emergency, help can access your medical conditions and blood type without breaking into the phone, apps operate smoothly, it's pocket-able, the screen size is perfect (not too small or too big), some apps have more built-in features on iPhone than Android, 
Cons: The only thing that I can think of at all is the price but then again, this is like carrying around a mini mac book pro in your pocket. 
If you're ever in the San Marcos TX area, go see Wesley on the weekends. He is their Apple expert. I don't think there is anything that he doesn't know. I went to him 2 weekends in a row asking him questions before pulling the trigger. It's one of the best purchases I have ever made and I'm an extremely frugal guy. I can honestly say that I feel good about the purchase. And for anyone interested in knowing this, because I wasn't sure of it myself, I purchased this iPhone unlocked and took it to my cell phone carrier Metro-PCS and it works amazing! My friend has an iPhone on Sprint and we've done tests side by side and mine beats his every time.",5,2018-09-22 19:26:00
"11","Samsung to iPhone","Was a Samsung guy since the Galaxy s4, bough a Note 8 when it launched. I found myself tired of constant apps quitting, slow speed, and other miscellaneous errors. Decided to grab an iPhone X and I can go on and on about how impressed I am, the new iPhone X and the operating system blows Android and Samsung so far out of the water, that I decided to purchase a MacBook Pro (currently trying to sell my Lenovo Y700), personally i like my MacBook just as much as my Lenovo running Windows 10 Pro but because of how impressed I am with my three week old iPhone X I purchased an Apple Watch Series 3... wayyy better than my Samsung Gear but at a slightly high price.

Pros: Smooth, Stylish, Fast, Reliable, Efficient, Jaw-Dropping Camera, works perfectly with my MacBook Pro and Apple Watch

Cons: I wish they made a ""Plus"" version, I am a fan of the Note 8s huge screen, and although the X has less pixel density it has a much higher contrast and color which provides a better picture... would complain about the price but my Note 8 costed the same (Note 8 is overpriced)",5,2018-04-20 23:31:00
"12","Finally iPhone with OLED!","Been waiting for so long with an iPhone with OLED screen. This phone takes a little getting used to when it comes to no physical home button or fingerprint scanner. But I noticed Face ID literally works 95% of the time every time I try it. The speakers are louder on this phone and also somehow my Bluetooth headphones seem to get louder also. The battery life is even better than the 7 plus I had. It also feels way better in your hand I recall dropping my 7 plus on my face countless times or not being able to reach every corner of the screen without using reach assist. Overall this is a really good phone",5,2017-11-11 01:42:00
"13","Best Device so Far....period","It's expensive...I know, I get it. But if you live on your device for work and personal reasons like me you want to drive a Ferrari -if possible. 
This device is a Ferrari! The processor is quick and responsive, the screen is brilliant and the exterior looks and feels very high end.
If you can afford it ( trade in your existing device!) you should treat yourself to this incredible machine...",5,2017-11-10 14:00:00
"14","Love the smaller footprint of this phone!","iPhone has done it, made the perfect phone for me. This replaced my iPhone 7+, which I had because of my 45 year old eyes. However, it was too big for my smaller hands. This iPhone X is perfect for me. The screen seems to be about the same size, but the phone has a much smaller footprint. I am so glad to finally have the phone I have wanted. This phone takes great pictures, and the gestures are very easy to figure out, I do not miss the home button at all. I have had the phone for 3 days. The battery lasts all day, I take it off the charger at 5:15, and when I put it back on the charger at night at 10, it is at like 40%. Face ID works most of the time, and I do find it better than using my finger. I think if you are on the fence about this iPhone 10, just go and play with it a bit at the store. It really is an awesome phone. I would also like to say that getting the phone at BestBuy and working with their phone people was the best. So much better than the service I got at the Verizon store. I highly recommend the iPhone X and BestBuy!!!",5,2017-11-12 09:12:00
"15","Great iPhone once again.","Awesome design and quality, feels so smooth in your hand. I have owned it for a couple years now and have zero complaints, I now have it to my
Wife and the phone is still working flawlessly with zero issue, no cracks or scratches. One of the best iPhones I have ever owned, and I have been with Apple since the iPhone 2g.",5,2019-12-05 22:58:00
"16","Worth the money","Earlier, tried all different apple iPhones older than iphone X. This one is definitely better with a Face ID. Large screen. Excellent camera. Magnificient screen display. Easy to use. With new discounts coming up every week at best buy and at other retailers, we should definitely get this one. Worth the money you pay for.",5,2019-07-22 14:49:00
"17","Meh, not worth the price...","I was on an iPhone 7+ and decided to move to the iPhone X when my daughter upgraded her phone to an X. I really didn't like it, which is disappointing. 

I liked the face recognition, but it wasn't perfect and without a fingerprint scanner, at times I had to maneuver the thing around my face to get an unlock. The notch didn't bother me at all but the narrowness of the screen really played havoc with watching video. You either dealt with a smaller window with bars or used the zoom for full screen but lost part of the picture. 

Another frustrating thing was on the iPhone X, you no longer have the ""Zoomed"" display option. I always ran my 7+ in Zoomed mode to slightly enlarge all the text and icons. Since that doesn't exist on the X, I felt like I downgraded to a smaller iphone 7 and it became annoying.

In evaluating things, I really didn't really feel like the price was worth what you get, especially for the 256gb version. It's just not worth the $15/mo extra premium above the iphone 8+ to me. At the end of the day, I decided to return it and I eventually went with the Galaxy S9+.

I'll probably take another look at the X series in an iteration or two, once Apple figures it out better with a bigger version and brings the price down to more comparable levels.",3,2018-03-31 20:01:00
"18","Love the design, but already problematic in cold","I've had every iPhone from 4 up to 7, then sprung for this one. The battery life for all iPhones I've had is much worse in the very cold weather -- yesterday, the first cold day in NYC this year, the battery died 99-0% in less than 30 minutes outside.

Still an amazing phone, but beware of that issue.",4,2017-11-11 11:28:00
"19","My first Apple phone","I was an android fanboy and never thought I would go Apple. After paying $800 for an S8+, using it for 6 months only to have it slow down and glitch through animations, I thought where do I turn now. I traded the phone in and decided to give the new notch phone a try for the 14 day return period. I was initially shocked at what experiencing a true “buttery” UI was really like. This phone is so smooth, extremely fast and the animations have never dropped a frame. The gesture based UI is natural and a smoother, chill way to use your phone, rather than hunting for a button to tap and then tapping it. You just swipe around in different ways and at some point you will do it without thought. I’ve had this phone over a year and it’s operating the same as the day I unboxed it. Expensive phone but I don’t see myself upgrading for a total of three years use, where I was itching to upgrade an android phone after 18 months. Yes, buy this phone.",5,2019-02-17 16:53:00
"20","Almost Perfect!","Of several iPhones I’ve owned over the years, this is by far my favorite yet. It is fast and sleek, durable (it’s been dropped without sustaining damage...with case and tempered glass screen protector of course), the display has brilliant colors, the camera has crisp resolution and many advanced features, and on top of all this it’s small enough to easily fit in a pocket or small purse.

Why four stars instead of five? This model is missing one critical feature that my last iPhone had...fingerprint recognition. I don’t care for facial id (my son is sneaky and can hold it up to my face unexpectedly for unauthorized access) so I use a 6 digit passcode instead. This comes with a trade-off though; the lack of a home button at the bottom of the screen provides more usable screen space in a smaller package. If Apple could simply use a rear button like its competitors for fingerprint recognition, this phone would have a solid five star rating.",4,2019-07-19 12:21:00
"21","A Powerful Device","I have had different iPhones and by far iPhone X is the most powerful one. The battery is perfect and the camera is awesome. highly recommended.",5,2020-01-10 20:29:00
"22","Love my phone!","It is almost two years that I purchase this phone form BB and I got to say there has been no issues at all, love my phone and the fact that I was able to go and get it in a breeze",5,2019-12-23 11:28:00
"23","I like it.","I bought this model phone when it came out, and it was solid until I dropped it, putting it in my pocket.  It was in a case and there was no outside damage but something happened inside.  The Wifi and Bluetooth stopped working. I choose to pay it off and replace it with the same phone in a different color.  I'm happy with my decision and have had no issues with the new one.  I'm planning on not upgrading and going to rock this one for a while.  This phone is amazing.​",5,2019-08-02 16:49:00
"24","Best phone for the money","Did a bunch of research and the consensus was that iPhone X was a better deal than xr or xs and that proved to be true. Best Buy had a really great price but much more important was that they were able to help my daughter set up her new phone. They also gave us fair trade in gift cards for the old phones. Only issue was when Verizon tried to charge us a monthly payment even though I paid cash in full. Better communication between Best Buy and Verizon would’ve been helpful.",5,2019-07-12 21:44:00
"25","Great iPhone","My wife loved this iPhone X and it worked and lasted great for 2 years until it was time for a free upgrade.",5,2020-01-15 10:05:00
"26","Great battery life","This phone is definitely a step up from my last (Samsung galaxy S8) and from other iPhones. I had an iPhone prior to having the Samsung. I originally switched to Samsung because I was tired of the same boring iPhone that hadn’t been redisigned in years, and I’m happy to say that the newer models are definitely different and better. The battery life is something else though, very powerful!! I use it the same amount that o used my old phone, and it lasts most of the day without a charge and heavy use. The camera is great, but takes some getting used to. The phone itself is also beautiful, I hate to put a case on it cause I like to show it off, but alas I can’t afford to break it after purchasing this with cash! The price a downfall, but I also purchased the 2 years of apple care and I’m always pleased with what their customer service is like.",5,2019-01-12 09:12:00
"27","Love it","I have been using this phone for over a year now and I am still impressed. Battery life is better than the previous models.",5,2019-12-26 12:49:00
"28","Good phone","Apple keeps coming up with great features.  Would highly recommend",5,2020-01-27 13:27:00

"30","Good phone","Was purchsed as a gift for someone.   So far no complaints with this phone.",5,2020-01-17 12:40:00
"31","Love Apple Products","After using other cellular brands, none have compared to the stability and quality Apple phones provide. For those reasons, when I upgraded from Iphone 6 I stayed with Apple to their Iphone X. The performance, screen quality, and having a complete screen on the front of the phone is awesome. I also like the wireless charging capability, though I would have liked to receive a wireless charger with the phone. So far, after owning it a month or two, it has been excellent. No complaints about my purchase and enjoying my experience. I just hope I don't drop it!",5,2019-03-31 16:03:00
"32","My girlfriend likes, scratch that, loves her new X","I purchased this for my girlfriend as an early Christmas present. She was upgrading from a regular 6 and couldn’t be happier. The Face ID feature really is a game changer. If you think you will miss Touch ID, don’t, and here is why... It has a feature that will automatically quiet notifications, rings, and alerts when it knows you’re looking at the phone. Super cool! No need to silence an incoming call right away. Also, whenever you open an app you no longer need to place your finger again. It automatically recognizes that it’s you and unlocks the app. You can also easily reply to a text right on the lock screen because the phone has already recognized that you are the authorized user. The gestures are really simple and accurate. I got myself one too. It was an upgrade from a 7 256GB. I hated the 7. Had issues all the time. This phone solved all of that!",5,2017-12-31 08:26:00
"33","iPhone gets better and better","I've been with Apple and iPHones for most of the generations. So I'm used to the functionality and nothing surprises me. With this new edition, I love the enhanced resolution of the video and pictures. The camera is quite better than its predecessors, but I figure that's what is expected from Apple with them competing with Samsung and others. The thing that I'm getting used to is the lack of home button on the face. Instead, Apple has the user swiping up from the bottom. The Face ID has it's faults such as not recognizing the face to its full capacity when it's dark or I have sunglasses on. I think there are minor tweaks I can make to the settings. All in all, I like the phone and continue to use Apple iPhones over the others.",5,2018-12-18 13:43:00

While having the button on the front, takes some getting used to the largest issue is the that the facial recognition takes a little longer than the old fingerprint scanner.  But that’s minor and in time, I’ll get used to that.  But the speed, storage and other features more than make up for it. Nice phone.",5,2019-06-24 10:57:00

"39","Great phone for a switch from Android","I'm usually a bit skeptical when phone companies come out with new features such as face unlock and mobile payment as they can have issues either in execution or adoption. When android first came out with a face unlock feature it was extremely sensitive to light and the contactless payment was not as widespread as it is now. Well 4 years later it looks like Apple has ironed these out and I can gladly say I'm very happy with the facial recognition in this phone. Was waiting for Apple to finally do something that was new, and they delivered spectacularly. Here's to hoping that I can keep the screen intact for the next four years given the cost of this compared to my last two Android phones.

Well worth the purchase!",5,2018-02-20 15:31:00

This phone is very nice not the most happy with the glass back but put a slim case on it to protect. Still need to figure out all it’s features as I haven’t even loooked them up. I got it for a gr8 deal from bestbuy 750.00 for the 256gb if u paid all up front which I did. These are limited as they are older but don’t hesitate as they have a better display than the XR",4,2019-08-24 10:03:00

There are a lot of features on the Samsung I used to use on a day to day basis that are not a thing on the iPhone.. things I took for granted. I decided to switch because of the ease of using Siri and iMessage. I got tired of screaming “Okay Google” and it not working. I’ve gotten used to the iPhone. It’s way easier to handle.",5,2019-06-22 13:28:00

"45","Best iPhone Experience","I've taken a break from an iPhone since the iPhone 4s and getting into the 10th anniversary iPhone has given me the feel and edge that Apple has polished their craftsmanship in its hardware and its software. The ecosystem from a Macbook to an iPhone and iCloud is so smooth, that iTunes helps give the cherry on top of the experience. I've always known that most developers create apps first for the iPhone and I can tell by the experience from the apps, it has no lag and bugs for the most part. I will eat my words on talking against iPhone fans, I love software and hardware when it works and it's always working for my experience.",5,2018-03-29 20:15:00
"46","Excellent","Waited a few months to acquire the iPhone X after some of the hype died down. Enjoyable user experience, love the updates. Functionality like no home button, is easy to get used to. All phones worth having are expensive nowadays so the price doesn't bother me, it's a computer in your hand that you spend the most time on and they're starting to charge as such. Best camera on an iPhone yet, but still doesn't compare to an Android. Every time I travel somewhere nice like Europe or Dubai, Apple cameras annoy me, but I can live with it otherwise since I already had all previous iterations. Large beautiful screen with crisp picture. If you have no Apple loyalties shop around, but this works for me and the Apple ecosystem connectivity that I continue to consciously buy into. At the end of the day, you have to chose a brand and Apple works for me.",5,2018-07-06 09:38:00
"47","Best iPhone yet.","I have had an iPhone for about 7 years now. When I got the 7 I told myself it was the last iPhone I would ever own. I had nothing but software glitches with it. When the 8 was announced I lost it and was screaming because I thought it was the new iPhone. I was sick of them changing a couple things and saying it was so much better. Then the x was announced. I was sceptical but I loved the way it looked. I figured if it’s just as bad as the 7 with glitches, it’s like having the same phone but at least it will look good doing it hahaha. So far I have had very few problems. The only thing that seems to happen, is when an app stretches the wrong way. Im not sure how to describe it, it’s like the x to close whatever may be open is in the far top left with the time rather than a little lower. When that happens you need to force close the app. It has happened 3 times and its impossible to replicate. Overall this iPhone has brought me hope that Apple may not be as far gone as I thought. I hope they focus on QA and having software that has no bugs like it was for so long. Also I miss having the plus. I hope they make a plus version of this in the future.",5,2017-12-05 09:30:00

"53","Nice Phone but aren't they all now???","Bought this for my wife, who needed an upgrade due to her iPhone 6s couldn't keep a charge for more than 3 hours. I'm not an Apple guy but seems like a good phone and I am sure it made her instantly cooler the second it was in her hand. It's great until the next one comes out, like everything these days.",4,2019-10-11 23:01:00
"54","Great phone for Apple fans","Although it takes some getting used to, the lack of home button on the device doesn’t bother you as much as you’d assume. After not too long you begin to swipe up to get to your home screen and you forget all about having a physical home button. I do miss the Touch ID though as the Face ID sometimes has difficulty in low-lighting. That too you begin to get accustomed to using, and it adapts to you and you to it overtime.",5,2018-09-28 22:54:00
"55","My pictures have never been better","I am an avid traveler that loves photographing EVERYTHING. I do not always feel like lugging around camera equipment but have found my iPhone to take great pics that many have felt were taken with professional equipment.",5,2019-08-21 23:21:00
"56","The best IPhone yet!","With a bigger screen than the plus models and a smaller footprint. The new iPhone already had a lot going for it, then add wireless charging, face ID, and the new more powerful chip shared with the other models. You come up with the most advanced iPhone the world has seen. It feels good in the hands. A camera that has to be seen in action to fully appreciate the quality, agile transitions between apps, stereo speakers, and the apple eco system that unites all your apple devices all coming together to give you the experience that's worth the upgrade to the iPhone 10. I guess X really does mark the spot.",5,2018-01-18 08:34:00
"57","Best phone ever","Have always had a Galaxy phone and finally moved to apple. The Face ID is so easy compared to have a code to type in. No home button was easy to get use to. It seem fast to use this phone then any other.",5,2017-11-14 09:56:00
"58","Love/hate relationship","Love the screen size, overall size of phone, speed, facial recognition is pretty easy. Camera is excellent. Do not like how sensitive the side buttons are. I’ve talked with my friends and they have the same issues:  screen shots when you’re not trying, butt calls, inadvertent SOS calls.  I know there are some operator errors, but It also locks up at least once a week. I switched from a 7 and quite frankly, had zero issues with the 7. I’d recommend, but with some reservations.",4,2019-07-05 17:28:00
"59","Love this phone!","At first I was hesitant about whether l wanted to upgrade to the X or the 8 plus and I’m so glad I went I went with the X. First, the size is absolutely perfect. I am a previous user of the 6 plus and it felt too big at times. This fits right in your hand and is the perfect size. It Doesn’t feel too small at all. The full size screen is awesome. I don’t even miss having a home key button at all. In fact after a couple of days of using this I completely forgot about it. Most of all, this camera is amazing. When using portrait mode pictures look professional and came out way better than I ever thought. This is one of the best phones I ever had. You cannot go wrong with the iPhone X",5,2018-08-03 22:04:00
"60","Yes it’s that good!","This phone is definitely the best iPhone yet. The Face ID is super easy and fast. The cameras are amazingly crisp and awesome portrait modes. The battery life is good and the wireless charging is a snap. Yes, Android folks are going to say we had a lot of it first, but I find iPhones are a lot simpler and user friendly when you’re not a computer genius that likes to jailbreak everything. Also, they don’t get all the viruses that androids do because they don’t let all the infected apps through. Well that’s my two cents at least. Take it for what it’s worth. I’m enjoying it very much.",5,2017-12-20 06:11:00
"61","Most improved iPhone to date","I've been through many iterations of iPhones (and Android phones, but that's another story) and the iPhone X is the most impressive and most improved iPhone to date. The things I love most are the new screen and the wireless charging. The OLED screen is a sight to behold. True Samsung has had them for years, but the color accuracy of the Samsungs aren't very good. They are vibrant, but not accurate. Watching videos, netflix and itunes, in HDR on this is quite nice. Also, yes it's true that Android phones have already had wireless charging in their phones for some time, so now to have it on iPhone is a very welcome addition. At work I have a Qi wireless charging stand and it works fantastically for both vertical and horizontal phone orientations.

Also another thing to note: having come from the Plus version of the iPhone to the X was a pretty noticeable change, but after only a couple of days usage, the smaller physical form factor size is a non-issue.",5,2017-11-17 12:42:00
"62","Best iPhone Ever!","I was looking to upgrade from my iPhone 7 and debating whether I should go with the larger screen of iPhone 8+. However, I just don’t like the feel of the larger phones in my hand. So, the choice came down to the smaller iPhone 8 or the iPhone X. After researching both I was still undecided if the X was worth the extra money. Until one day I was in Best Buy and I placed my 7 on top of the X and saw it was basically the same size and had a much larger screen. That made it an easy choice!

I love the face recognition, the beautiful detail of the new screen, and the upgraded camera. I’m an avid amateur photographer and I always scoffed at phone cameras. Not anymore!

The only bad thing about getting the iPhone X is that my wife loved mine so much that I had to buy her one too! She had the 7+ and loves the X’s screen too!",5,2018-03-09 20:28:00
"63","Great phone","I love my iPhone X, has a great camera and worth ever penny!",5,2019-12-09 10:22:00
"64","Best iPhone yet","The iPhone X is easily the best iPhone yet, love the fact of the viewable portion of the screen is larger than the 8+, yet the phone is smaller than the 8+ and only a fraction larger than 8. People complain that apple’s technology seems behind however I would offer that none of the technology is “glitchy“ and works seamlessly and flawlessly which is a win over most android phones. People also complained of the phone is $1000 when I would offer that I never hear anybody complaining that the newest Google pixel is right at about $1000 As well as the new Samsung Is in the same boat.",5,2017-12-02 04:50:00
"65","Slick and Convenient","I love the new IPhone 10 (aka X). It takes about a day to get used to not having the home button. However once you are used to it you will find it is very convenient switching between app to app without it. I love the large storage and am no longer afraid of having to pick and choose which apps to keep and which to delete. Best Buy had the best deal which allowed me to trade in my old phone to get a Best Buy gift card. This could be used for the tax on the phone, a down payment towards it if you are choosing to finance it, or accessories. I purchased a case, glass protection, a wireless charger, paid the tax on the phone and still had money leftover. Would definitely recommend over trading into your phone service provider. The large screen is excellent and sound is very clear. The camera works so swell you can see sweat droplets! Very satisfied with my purchase.",5,2018-01-16 03:01:00
"66","iPhone","I love this iPhone now I recently upgraded to the 11 but I had gone from the 6 to this one and there were a lot of changes",5,2019-10-17 18:16:00
"67","Iphone","Love my iPhone. I had changed to Samsung and went back to iPhone and I am super happy I did.",5,2019-11-10 07:27:00
"68","Not that great","I couldn't decide between the 8+ or the X but chose the X since it was closer in size to the iPhone 6s I was upgrading from and I'm honestly not that impressed. Yes, the camera is great on it, but honestly that's about the only good feature this has to offer. I really don't like having Face ID and I wish I could go back to using the thumbprint. Face ID barely works half the time, I've added my face to it under multiple lightings so it would.The first week I had it it froze for a solid 15min. It has cool features and all but it's really not all it's hyped up to be. I thought I was the only one who thought this because I've been on the fence about returning it or not, but what other options are there really? Several people I know who have also recently upgraded aren't that impressed with it either. Be prepared to google how to do most things on it when you first get it because apple made it way more confusing than it needs to be. My main complaint about the phone really is the face ID, other than that, it's a phone, it works, it's just not that great. If you want a phone similar in size to a 6 though, this is the way to go instead of the 8+ unfortunately.",3,2018-06-04 10:17:00
"69","I really love the new IPhone .","It’s everything you love about the IPhone with a few more bells and whistles. Face recognition scanning, Better gaming graphics, the screen looks amazing with added Samsung OLED technology, and really with no headphone jack really doesn’t matter (if don’t have a Bluetooth headset get one. It’s 2017!) . Camera really takes great pictures. I’ve liked the way IPhone has done things for the last 10 yrs, and this a brilliant Design and has amazing battery life. It’s not a customizable as Android phones, if your into that check out the Samsung line up.",5,2017-12-21 21:50:00
"70","FaceID - Game Changer","I am coming from a 6S plus and decided to take up the BOGO on the iPhone 8 when I bought the iPhone X.

The X is very different from my 6S plus in that it is physically smaller but the overall screen size is about the same. I really enjoy the smaller form factor.

The biggest difference is FaceID. It takes a bit of getting used to but that won't take long. Now, about a month into ownership, going back to TouchID seems foreign and bit outdated. One thing that I don't like about FaceID is that you can't really use it while in bed - it a bit picky on the angle that it needs to pick up your face.",5,2018-08-24 12:37:00
"71","Better Than Expected","I was a little reluctant to go back to Apple but I have been very happy with the iPhone X. The screen is great, phone is responsive, and I've adapted to the dreaded notch. Can't wait for IOS 13 to get dark mode. Battery life is great and everything has worked without issue.",5,2019-06-07 12:24:00
"72","Best iphone","Best iPhone ever! Battery is amazing, phone is amazing, keeping it for a while.",5,2019-11-16 10:10:00
"73","Got a great deal!","Sweet deal for being an older model. I reviewed the specs and figured out that for what I use it for I didn't have to buy the latest and greatest iPhone. I went with this one because it is very comparable options for the price. I'm happy with my purchase.",5,2019-06-21 17:21:00
"74","Another great iPhone","What can I say this is just another great iPhone!
Great screen resolution, size is perfect. Operating is a breeze.",5,2019-10-17 18:12:00
"75","Great battery life and camera features","I love this phone!  It has face recognition to unlock which is really cool and there is a long battery life!  The camera on this phone is great and takes fantastic photos.  I’m having absolutely no problems with this phone and happy I made this choice!",5,2019-06-22 03:32:00
"76","love it,, yes i would reccomend","love it,, yes i would recommend this item to everyone",5,2019-12-02 23:15:00
"77","Good but not great","The screen is big and beautiful and the camera takes great photos and videos. The lack of a home button is akward, and having to swipe up from the bottom can be a nuisance (very easy to hang up on someone if you try to unlock your phone while in the middle of a call, for instance). Also, the FaceID feature is unreliable, working about half the time when trying to unlock my phone or download an app. Overall I think the 8 Plus would be a better choice, especially for the price difference.",4,2017-11-25 06:15:00
"78","Huge Upgrade!","Such a great upgrade to my very outdated iPhone 5. I was worried it would be difficult to get a hang of it, but it was actually very simple and, after watching a couple of brief youtube videos, I would say I was almost 100% functional as compared to my old phone.",5,2019-05-30 11:42:00
"79","Mush better than expected","The iPhone X experience has been a wild pleasant surprise. My first thoughts was that it was a so-so update....I WAS DEAD WRONG!!! Slightly larger screen.....but the X takes the image all the way to the edges, so much more impactful than I thought! Facial recognition??? also thought this was a ho-hum improvement.....WRONG AGAIN. The facial recognition is incredible. Next the absence of the action button at the bottom of the screen...WOW...it is just now a SWIPE!

All in all the X is worth the money, though I really believe the price should be -$200!

A pleasant surprise.",5,2018-07-27 19:43:00
"80","Excellent phone!","I love this phone! I've tried all of the current Apple phones (8, 8+, & X) and I find this to be the perfect phone, for me. I love the large screen of the 8+ but I can't hold the 8+ in one hand and type/navigate - with the X I can. Of course I can with the 8 as well but the 8 lacks the camera of the 8+ and the X (maybe Apple should consider giving the 8 the same camera as the +?) I realize this phone still has it's kinks to work out and I would like some kind of touch sensor when I can't pick it up and look at it, but it's a great phone! When people talk about comparing the screen of the X to the 8/8+ you can definitely tell the difference in the quality and clarity.",5,2018-04-23 11:28:00
"81","My son loves it","This is my son's first iPhone. He and I have always been on android, though his other siblings have had iPhones for years. Finally, as his old phone started to have issues, he decided to upgrade. He went with the iPhone X because all of his friends are on iPhones, so it lets him chat with them in group chats like the rest of them do (sorry, don't remember the name of the iChat or whatever the group chat program that they use is).
He's very happy with it.
A bit of a learning curve switching to the new phone, but within one evening of playing with it he was up to speed and he loves it.",5,2018-07-12 15:21:00
"82","Outstanding","got this for my wife, and she absolutely loves it, especially the quality of photos taken with it.",5,2019-10-18 13:12:00
"83","Nice, but expensive","The iPhone X screen size is nice for a phone that is also smaller and lighter weight than an 8 Plus. Processing is fast, and the dual-camera photo options make taking pictures easier and better. The use of additional swipe and 3D touch motions instead of a home button is a little more cumbersome. Overall a nice phone, but if you don't mind the size of the iPhone 8 Plus, not sure the X is worth the added cost.",5,2018-05-19 20:04:00

"86","amazing camera","I love my X! I had upgraded from the iphone 7 and the only difference really is the camera. Other than that it is the same iphone. My battery was amazing in the beginning and now that I am four months in, I'm starting to notice that I have to leave it on battery saver mode more often than I did in the beginning. However, the declining battery life is nothing new for iphone users. One time my phone freaked out where it froze and the screen would not turn off and it was not sending me notifications, but I could see that I was getting messges. I had to take it to the apple store where they told me to force shut it down by pressing volume up and the power button.",5,2018-04-19 09:57:00
"87","Best phone I've had","I've always loved having an iPhone, so when i decided to get the iPhone X, i told myself I wanted something different than what I was used to. I had been debating between the 8 and X, and finally decided on the X because I loved the idea of no home button and the nicer camera. Definitely made the right choice. I love the camera and it took only a day to get used to not having a home button. It feels like a completely different phone, but still an iPhone. Love it!",5,2018-11-06 18:07:00

Obviously we can do more stuff with these than with the 7s, but whatever. I recommend them if you like doing “stuff” on your phones. He’s already on my case about upgrading to the new 10r or s or whatever the letters that just came out. I think he’s just hardcore FOMOing, but what do I know.",5,2018-11-28 20:55:00
"89","Easy to use","I am a big apple product fan and the iPhone X has not disappointed me. It was a really easy transition from the home button of the past to no one button on the X. I was worried it would be cumbersome, but it is not at all. The face ID feature is so great and works in dim light just as easy as it does in the daylight. I'm very happy with the iPhone X.",5,2017-11-16 10:27:00
"90","Love everything about it","So glad to have purchased this phone with additional storage.  Really enjoying my purchase.",5,2019-10-19 10:07:00
"91","Best screen ever and great battery life","I'm very pleased with screen quality and increased size, new gestures are easy to get used to and Face ID seems to be very secure. Another great benefit of upgrading to this device is increased battery life due to energy efficient screen.",5,2019-01-16 20:50:00
"92","Really like this phone","Upgraded from an iPhone 7 —and really like this new phone.  I like that the physical size is similar but the screen utilizes the entire screen (no borders). The facial recognition is great and the camera is amazingly good.",5,2019-06-19 23:12:00
"93","iPhone X","A great phone! The screen is larger than the old iPhone 5C, but this is not an issue. The screen is clear and bright. The iPhone X is costly, but we look forward to years of trouble free service. Wireless charging is great, but this was not the reason for the purchase.",5,2019-05-03 16:05:00
"94","Love this phone!","I have been purchasing iPhones for 10 years. Apple does not disappoint when coming out with a new version of iPhone. It weighs significantly more than iPhone 6/7/8, but makes up for in performance. I would however suggest to go with a great phone carrier as Sprint is horrible.",5,2018-11-10 20:07:00

"96","Amazing screen","Best iPhone yet. The screen and calibration of the colors is amazing from the factory. I wish my OLED tv was as good as this iPhone X screen. I own a newer Galaxy phone I use at work and this iPhone is a step up in quality you feel after using both. The sound quality when listening to music or even YouTube videos is the loudest and clearest I’ve herd from all the phones I’ve tried.

"99","Returned to Apple for the X","Apple continues to impress. In December I switched from the iPhone 7 Plus to a Galaxy Note 8. Being so ingrained in Apple's ecosystem (iPad, Apple TV, MacBook), I got frustrated and finally bit the bullet to switch back. I was skeptical about the face unlock, but it really does work seamlessly. The team at apple truly is the best at understanding functionality, as I was navigating without a home button like a pro within an hour (also something I was nervous about). Even this ""late"" in the iPhone X's life, I would still recommend buying it.",5,2018-07-13 12:33:00
"100","Great Phone","I just got this iPhone X on Friday May 12, 2018 and so far I love this phone. I especially wanted this phone, because of the fact that is waterproof and I work at a farm doing various jobs where it could possibly be exposed to wet conditions. I do miss that it does'nt show the battery life remaining on the top right of the phone like my old iPhone 6. I have always been very impressed with Apple products and how very well they outlive themselves with no problems or repairs required. I wasn't sure if I was going to like the face recognition and no home button, but so far it has been fine.",5,2018-05-16 18:47:00

"103","Best IPhone Ever","The price did make me think more than twice about getting this phone but it truly is the best IPhone ever. So fast and the upgrades make it well worth the price.

"105","Dope phone but...","I love my iPhone X, best iPhone I’ve ever owned. Love how fast it is. Love the Face ID (scans face fast for unlock). The OLED screen is beautiful and the all screen display is wonderful (besides the notch, which doesn’t really bother me). Only reason I give it 4 stars and not 5 is because the price tag is ridiculous. You can buy a much better phone as far as specs go for a much cheaper if not half the price but because it’s an Apple phone the price of over $1000 is outrageous. Only reason I bought this phone for me and my wife is because we both had iPhone 5s and it was slowing down tremendously and battery draining like a gas leak. We are both Apple fans because we love the simplicity of it and most of my family has an iPhone which makes iMessage and FaceTime a must for us. Other than the outrageous price tag this is a great phone. Dropped it a few times already (with a simple bumper case) and noticed zero damage to it.",4,2018-07-23 18:26:00
"106","Good iPhone, not dissatisfied at all","New interface is easy to figure out.
Having 256GB is great. Can download movies and take lots of pictures and videos.
Silver finish looks very good, recommend Urban Armor Gear (UAG) cases with it.
Not as advanced as the new iPhone XS, but advanced enough to last a very long time (honestly, there’s not much of a noticeable difference between the two iPhones).
Face ID works very well, however in some cases (like laying in bed on your side), it has a hard time recognizing your face and this is where Touch ID might be preferred. In most cases, Face ID is quicker and easier than Touch ID (and more fun with the new Memoji and Animoji).
Having the “all screen” display is great and looking back at older iPhones, it’s just not the same as you would think.
Overall, I wouldn’t want any other iPhone than an iPhone X!",4,2018-09-19 10:35:00
"107","It's Worth It","Maybe it's self-indulgent of me, but I'm glad I spent the extra money to get the iPhone X. The screen is great, and the facial recognition works amazingly well--much easier than the fingerprint reader. Was somewhat concerned that the lack of a home button would make going back and forth between iPod and iPhone X confusing, but that hasn't been the case. The new process is, if anything, easier, and the devices are different enough that I have had no tendency to try to use the wrong set of movements on either. Upgraded from a 2-year-old iPhone SE and have been extremely happy with the move.",5,2018-04-20 14:22:00

It works 99% of the time ... the other time I am doing something wrong ... like covering the lens with my finger ... moving out of in from it of the camera!

For those who say it doesn’t work sometimes ... they are doing something themselves because like most Apple products this just works!

I had been on the fence with my 6s for a while debating if it was worth going for the X or just getting an 8. I'm glad I went with the X. The new features of the X simply work, and feel very natural.

Now if gestures, FaceID, and some of the additional new features don't matter to you, then an 8 will suite you just fine. You could say that the iPhone X is for ""enthusiasts"" .",5,2017-12-15 14:53:00
"114","Great phone","This was a great phone when I purchased it. However the battery life didn’t hold up.",5,2019-10-05 12:46:00
"115","Great Phone, Best Iphone Yet","I have had this phone for 2 weeks. The gentleman who sold me the phone was very knowledgable about the Iphone and gave me the tools I needed to deal with the lack of a home button. Now, I wonder why we ever needed a home button to begin with. This is a solid phone, slightly bigger than my old Iphone 6 but with a great screen that is bigger than my wife's Iphone 6 Plus. Battery life is great, after 2 days use, I still have about 50% battery. I have no complaints. Apple Forever. I need to get a new Ipad Pro.",5,2018-06-27 20:49:00
"116","Great iPhone of the Times","I’ve been using this phone for the past month and I’ve already transitioned from using a home button to swiping up in It’s place. I’ve also gotten used to it’s size and speed, it’s unmatched in most of its specs to the iPhone 7 that I did have and I appreciated the help of the Best Buy employees that helped me get this phone.",5,2019-01-25 17:46:00
"117","Switched from Galaxy","Switched from my Galaxy S8 to get my first iPhone since the iPhone 4. I am not disappointed. Love my iPhone X",5,2019-09-06 19:10:00
"118","Great phone with great canera","I’ve had this phone over two years now and it still works like new",5,2019-10-17 18:33:00
"119","Liking the change to iPhone X","We needed to upgrade to iPhone for a specific service app my wife needs. I love my new iPhone X. I am still learning how to do things which I found easy to do on my last phone, but this pone can do so much more. About half way in the learning curve.",5,2019-04-12 18:03:00
"120","Love Apple Products","Great phone. User friendly. As long as you manage your pictures & videos properly, 256GB capacity goes a long way. My kids love that it is waterproof as it allows you to take underwater pictures.",5,2019-06-08 05:55:00
"121","Apple","Awesome phone one of the best ones yet. I really like the camera.",5,2019-10-17 17:14:00
"122","Still beats flagships phones after 1.5 years","Still going on strong after 1.5 years. No noticeable signs of slowing down, the battery has surprisingly lived up. Wife has dropped it a couple of times but luckily did not shatter the front or back glass - although I did buy apple care just in case. Overall a quality product from Apple.",5,2019-02-26 14:50:00
"123","WOW","What can you say about this beautiful quality product",5,2019-10-28 22:48:00
"124","Converted the husband to an iPhone user!","Bought this for my husband after his Android device died. Great value. And the husband hasn’t missed his Android one bit!",5,2019-08-21 22:17:00
"125","A needed upgrade","This phone is exactly what I was hoping for-user friendly, great battery life, and an outstanding camera.  I wish I would’ve upgraded sooner.",5,2019-07-28 07:29:00
"126","Great Phone/Camera","Same footprint as iPhone6 but much bigger screen. Love Face ID over fingerprint unlock as the iPhone 6 always seemed to lose or not recognize my fingerprint. Camera produces much better pictures. Loss of home button is no big deal - only took a few days to get used to swiping up from the bottom or various other swipes to replace other actions. Am missing the separate headset jack but plan to order a pair of wireless earbuds and should be good to go.",5,2018-08-03 16:07:00
"127","Great New iPhone X","Amazing Design, Great, Quality feeling phone and device. Upgrading from an iPhone 6, one can definitely tell the difference. The weight increases because of the glass design added for wireless charging. The new cameras are amazing and you’ll love the portrait mode and 4K video capture. Overall great phone and innovation from Apple.",5,2018-12-27 12:05:00
"128","Great Phone","I am very pleased with my purchase. I wish for the price you got a charging pad and the air pods. However, I understand that Apple wants to be able to make money off of those products. I haven't upgraded since the iPhone 6 so this was a big step up for me and I am glad I did it.",5,2017-11-26 12:05:00
"129","Yup slaps nicely","Product slaps like a truck, that OLED display rocks the XR one any day and get sprint deals lit.",5,2019-09-06 15:50:00
"130","Best phone I’ve had!","I have had many phones that were Apple and Samsung’s. This phone far out performs any of them! I had the note 8 before this and The retina unlock never really worked so I was skeptical of the facial recognition. This is night and day different. I’ve grown a beard and it still works. Sunglasses on it works. In a pitch black room it works. Apple perfected this! I missed the home button at first but not anymore. I don’t think I’d wanna go back at this point. All in all this phone is just great at how well it does everything I need it too.",5,2018-03-17 10:05:00
"131","Different but great!","The iPhone X is everything advertised. It takes some getting used to but the phone itself is amazing. High quality pictures. The Face ID actually is really protective and works really well even from different angles. I love the fact it has wireless charging capabilities and most important: it’s still an iPhone! The screen size (phone size from the iPhone 7+) isn’t as good as I expected but the fact the screen is so big makes up for this.",5,2018-07-20 18:01:00
"132","Worth the upgrade from the 7 Plus","Like size and facial recognition for sure. Has some bugs that need to be fixed. Worth upgrading if you like the screen size but want to shed the bulk of the 7 Plus. Wireless charging is a nice feature that I like more that I thought I would. Impresssd but not floored.",5,2017-11-17 16:39:00
"133","Awesome phone","This phone is great - easy to adapt to and I continue to discover things it always or will allow me to do.",5,2019-08-21 21:39:00
"134","Love My Phone","This is the original iPhone X and it works just like it's supposed to. It does everything I want it to. It worked very well in Vietnam with an in country chip. This is a great phone",5,2019-05-31 17:05:00
"135","Great evolution of the iPhone","I love this phone! The battery life is better than I expected, the speed & quality of the screen & camera are great except for the hit or miss portrait mode on the camera. The gestures that take the place of the home button seem to be pretty intuitive. The Face ID works better than I thought it was but isn’t perfect. Overall if you are coming from an older phone ( I had an iPhone 5s) I would recommend upgrading!",5,2018-08-18 19:22:00
"136","New favorite","I was Samsung Galaxy phones all the way, even when my husband had an iPhone. Well upgrade time came and I decided to give it a try. I will not be going back to an android as long as Apple keeps their game up. I love this phone. So easy to use and lots of features I still haven’t figured out yet.",5,2019-01-16 18:31:00
"137","Memory and Battery Life","So far, so good with the ability to use phone without worrying about storage or running out of juice! The camera and bigger screen are added bonuses.",5,2019-07-05 17:07:00
"138","Best iPhone","This is the best iPhone I ever had look good has wireless charging Face ID and is very fast",5,2019-09-04 23:17:00
"139","Great upgrade","This was a perfect upgrade for me.  I went from the 7 to this and this model was less expensive than one with less memory.",5,2019-08-02 16:51:00
"140","Best phone ever owned.","After years of saying iDont to Apple this phone won me over. A year later still my favorite phone. It’s so good I don’t even have upgrade fever when new phones come out. Which will likely apples fault for not wowing me with their new phones.",5,2019-03-20 18:29:00
"141","Perfect Phone","Absolutely love this phone and all it’s features! The camera is amazing and the pictures are such high quality. Got a great deal for the 256 model, very happy with this purchase.",5,2019-06-01 04:32:00
"142","Nice upgrade","Bought mainly for pictures on a trip to Hawaii. Took great photos and was easy to adjust to this model.",5,2019-08-21 23:19:00
"143","The best iPhone I’ve ever owned","So I’ve owned pretty much every iPhone that has been released save the S series. I’ve owned the 3G, 4, 5, 6Plus, 7 and now the X. This phone is fast and the display is gorgeous. Very bright, vivid and clear. The lack of a home button takes a little getting used to but it’s not hard. The facial recognition option is okay but need improvement. Overall I’m extremely satisfied.",5,2018-10-01 15:27:00
"144","Good phone horrible price","iPhones are top sellers because they're a status symbol. I bought this phone for my mom and it was a huge upgrade for her since she had the iPhone C, she loves it and the screen is beautiful and finally a phone with Amoled made by Samsung. Its fast only down side is the fast charger isn't included it also is super expensive for a phone that dosent have much features like android does. But overall my mom is happy and it's a huge step up from her old 5C",4,2019-03-03 23:48:00
"145","I like it.","It’s a good phone. I really had to upgrade from my iPhone 6 so to me it was a big upgrade. I do sometimes notice that the camera is a little blurry and I have to close the camera app and launch it again and it’s clear. Not sure what that’s about. The phone also heats up pretty quick. Not all the time but sometimes. Other than that I love it. It’s fast.",4,2018-12-19 17:15:00
"146","Awesome phone","Love the new features of the X! The phone itself is smaller than my 6s plus that I had without losing screen size due to the screen going all the way to the edges. Great camara and facial recognition works awesome! Easy to use! Don’t miss the home button at all! The only downfall is that if I’m using the headphones and watching a movie, I can’t charge it at the same time. However, the battery life seems to way improved from my previous iPhone!",5,2018-06-23 09:38:00
"147","Worth It!","Prior to my purchase of the iPhone X, I was debating whether or not it was worth it. My wife has the 8 plus and loves it. I decided to take the leap and commit. I am so glad I did. The clarity of front and rear facing cameras are exceptional. The Animoji is purely awesome! If you are contemplating X vs. 8 plus, unless you are a newbie to Apple, take the plunge. The only thing I am getting used to is no home button, but that is super minor.",5,2018-06-20 19:03:00
"148","Love my 10X","Wow, I’m in love with this iPhone! Face ID works perfectly every time, smooth upward response to open, easy open and close apps. The size is perfect for my smaller hands and lighter than the 7+ I had before....even with the otterbox cover.....fits nice. The sound system is exceptional and the pictures are flawless. I’m very happy with this 10X iPhone....and, oh yea......great as a phone....no garbling notices like the 7+.",5,2018-07-13 14:16:00
"149","its worth every penny","I wasn't planning on getting the iphone x when Apple first made an announcement. I get a new iphone every year. 

However, I couldnt resist and had to make the purchase. But iphone x is the best iphone ever. The battery life is amazing. the battery life alone is worth every penny. Also, once you get used to the hand gestures, you wont miss the home button at all.",5,2017-12-01 16:32:00
"150","Just excited to have a new phone","The X was amazing when it came out   Bought this 6/2018, now 6/2019 there are newer devices, but we still have this phone.  Works great! Camera is amazing!",5,2019-06-19 17:41:00
"151","Great phone - more than I hoped for.","Would have bought it sooner. Was having trouble with my 5S. Finally I had to do something. I really like the X. The whole screen view is great and the no home button took me about 30 seconds to get used to and I'm not a young person. My salesperson, Sydney was a gem. She knew her stuff. Was efficient and actually I ended up buying an apple watch several weeks later as we talked about hers and liked it so well.",5,2018-07-29 15:42:00
"152","GreatPhone","Super phone easy to transition to new commands and controls no bugs or issue. Easy to sign up and transition memory to new phone",5,2019-07-17 17:55:00
"153","My kind of phone","I love this phone. It’s the right size for my needs, and I love the features that comes with it.",5,2019-08-22 00:23:00
"154","Was a Skeptic","Took awhile for me to take the leap and upgrade from my iPhone 6. I am so glad I finally did it!! The iPhone X is a great device!! Thought adjusting from the lack of home button would be tough but it took me about ten minutes to adjust. Face ID is pretty cool and works both with and without my sunglasses on. The screen size and quality are awesome! Camera is amazing! Two thumbs up from me!!",5,2018-08-19 09:12:00
"155","iPhoneX","there is nothing like an iPhoneX just maybe a Samsung. Not sure my friend swears by the Samsung. I highly feel the iPhoneX is the way to go for a very good quality smartphone and support is great",5,2019-04-24 03:28:00
"156","Awesome iPhone","I have had multiple iPhones in the last 5-6 years, but this is my favorite. Love the screen and lack of a home button, after getting used to it. Couldn’t imagine anything else.",5,2019-05-15 17:20:00
"157","Great Phone!","This was actually for my daughter, but she absolutely loves this phone! The display is incredible, it was affordable, and its an IPhone, so you know it is going to work predictably. I would highly recommend this phone to anyone looking to upgrade.",5,2019-02-15 13:16:00
"158","Why buy your iphone anywhere else?","I replaced an iphone 6+ with a new iphone X this weekend and the experience was outstanding. Not only did they provide top dollar in bestbuy credit for the replacement phone but we got an excellent deal on a case. The bestbuy representative did everything required to setup and transfer all our apps, media, etc. It takes about an hour but we walked out with a new phone, case and some extra credit on a best buy rewards card. Shopping at Apple or a carrier is not as forgiving as shopping at BestBuy. Thank you and great job.",5,2018-01-07 06:46:00
"159","Better than expected","When paying over four digits for a phone you’d expect it to be great. The iPhone X doesn’t disappoint. Every aspect of the phone is amazing from screen, to speakers. Is there room for improvement? Of course, the answer to that will always be yes (that’s why there will be a new iPhone next year). The part I’m referring to that needs improvement is the battery, I use my phone heavily (hours of calls + LTE videos), but for the average user the battery should be sufficient. 5/5 from me, a random guy in the internet.",5,2018-01-17 17:49:00
"160","Sleek","Love this iPhone! My previous phone was the iPhone 6 which was great but the X is just phenomenal. Love the large screen. Functions are amazing and I find new things all the time. A true wonder.",5,2019-04-17 20:16:00
"161","Love the full screen !","Love that it doesn’t have a border around the phone. It works as expected , as it is an up grade from my IPHONE 6. Easy to use too !",5,2019-06-29 09:38:00
"162","Love the camera on this phone!","Really enjoying my purchase so far! I don’t use the creepy facial recognition features, but love the camera quality!",5,2019-07-17 18:19:00
"163","Great upgrade from an iPhone 6","My iPhone 6 was getting really sluggish and I thought long and hard about whether to go for an 8 or an X as an upgrade. I'm so glad I went with the X. It's familiar but different enough that I feel like I got something new. The new features take a little getting used to but overall very happy with my decision. The trade in / upgrade process at Best Buy was great too - totally frictionless experience.",5,2018-06-29 13:04:00
"164","Awesome phone, not worth the upgarde from iPhone 7","I cannot lie, I love my new iPhone X, but I am finding that it is probably not worth the cost of the upgrade from the 7. I suppose if you have an earlier iPhone it may be worth it, but the feature set is not that different. The screen is slightly larger and the facial recognition is neat, but I found the touch ID to be more reliable after a few days of use. Nice phone, not worth the additional cost to upgrade. Oh, and definitely get Applecare... my wife dropped hers before we put a case on it and the back cracked. Very fragile.",4,2018-03-06 10:15:00

"169","It’s a phone","It’s designed to steal your soul and your joy, but it does what it does quite well.",5,2019-08-21 22:09:00
"170","Great phone","The iPhone X was a huge gamble from Apple, but one that really paid off. Losing the home button and altering the design was a dangerous move, but one that was sorely needed after years of similarity and the premium design, extra power, all-screen front mix together to create - by far - the best iPhone Apple's ever made. It's impossible to give a perfect score to something that costs this much - but this is the closest to smartphone perfection Apple has ever got.",5,2018-03-10 12:39:00
"171","Great Phone","Great phone! I was use to the iphone 7 and it took a while to get use to it as it has no home button but after all it is a great phone.",5,2019-06-19 18:19:00
"172","Overall great phone","The iPhone X has a stunning display and decent size! Although I do miss the overall size of the iPhone 8 Plus that I used to own this phones siz me is great. I do miss the home button but Face ID is not too bad; I find it pretty quick but sometimes cumbersome. The features are pretty much aligned with what we’re accustomed to from apple. It is definitely a much faster phone! Great phone overall. I would definitely would recommend this phone to everyone.",4,2019-01-16 19:51:00
"173","Love this Phone!","At first I was hesitant to buy the iPhone X due to it being smaller than my 6 Plus. Yet, after spending a few hours with it and getting a feel for it, I absolutely love it. It’s operating system is infinitely faster, the ringing feature where the volume is auto adjusted depending on if you’re looking at your phone is pleasing, and Face ID makes unlocking the phone much easier.",5,2018-07-20 17:13:00
"174","Love this product","We used to be Samsung people in tell we had a lot of problems with them then we turned them in and got a iPhone X and I wouldn't turn it in for the world I love it and all you can do with it I am in school and I use my phone a lot and I never have issues with it. I would recommend this to anyone it is a lot better than Samsung. I am a true iPhone lover",5,2018-08-26 15:01:00
"175","Worthy upgrade from an older Iphone","I was “forced” into an upgrade when I dropped my 6 plus and smashed the screen. I was just going to get an 8 plus but decided that it was too similar to my old phone and what something different. I was skeptical of the X but after a couple days with it I’m happy with the direction Apple went with the phone. There were a couple things to get used to such as the lack of the home button and how to get to the quick menu but now I’m acclimated and appreciate the change.",5,2018-02-21 16:40:00

"179","Bought for my mom","I picked this phone up for my mom, she was just loving her iphone 6 plus so I thought she should have the newest device, it took her some time to learn how to function the phone with just gestures, but when she got it down she couldn't be stopped. Im glad she likes it",5,2018-12-20 05:30:00
"180","Love the iPhone X","I upgraded from 6 plus to this iPhoneX, love the screen size. Need to get used to no home button, but by second day I did not miss the Home button any more. Easy to take pictures & videos, very clear & sharp. I ended up bought the apple care , because I got nervous for price of iPhone X 256GB that I paid for. Best Buy has a promotion on iPhone X, very good deal. Yes, I also got a nice strong case to protect.",5,2018-05-16 18:15:00

"183","Love the X","I am happy with the purchase. I was concerned about the facial recognition but that has not been an issue. I love the large screen and the camera's Portrait mode is great as well. I did take a bit getting used to the different features from my 6S such as no Home button and swipe from top right for the quick access section. Overall I am very happy with my purchase.",5,2018-07-23 13:06:00
"184","Best one so far","I have used iPhones since VZW started supporting them with the iPhone 4. Later upgraded to a 5S, then a 6 Plus. They continued to get better and better. The Plus increase in size was welcomed, but with a durable case became too bulky to comfortably fit it in your pocket. The iPhone X FaceID when initially announced was not a reason to upgrade, however the accuracy, performance, and form factor make up for a great phone. Perfect size and excellent performance and features.",5,2018-01-19 19:27:00
"185","Great Phone","Upgraded from a 6 SE to this phone and love it. I tend to hold on to old phones for a bit before upgrading, as I like my upgrades to truly be upgrades. While the layout and utilization of the phone is similar, the functionality is obviously much improved. Definitely recommend upgrading to if you haven’t done so already.",5,2018-09-28 16:49:00
"186","iPhone X best iPhone","I pre ordered Oct 31st and received my IPhone Silver Nov 9th, which is great! 1st off I was skeptical with apple removing Touch ID/home button, but honestly within 15mins of playing with this new phone I was able to get use to the new gesture controls. 2nd Face ID when setting it up, very easy! Face ID works practically each time and is fast. 3rd I love that the battery life is better and last but not least Selfie Portait modes! Wireless charging isn’t something I’m big on but I’m glad it’s a capability now.",5,2017-11-10 09:00:00
"187","Best iphone yet","I’m a fan of the iPhones, had almost all the models since the first iPhone that was released in 2007. I have to say that the iPhone X is the best one by far. Perfect size, good battery live, fast. Not sure what I will upgrade to after this one.",5,2019-01-16 18:03:00
"188","LOVE!","I was NOT too excited about the loss of home key on this. I was worried I would not be able to adjust to it but after about two days, I don't ever miss that home button! My iphone X is quick. The screen/ picture quality is absolutely amazing and it feels so much better to hold than an iphone PLUS. It was actually cheaper payments to upgrade to the newest version. I am so glad I did! If you're not sure if it's worth the upgrade, try it! You'll love it too!",5,2018-02-10 18:59:00
"189","best I Phone I ever had","This is one of the fastest phone I ever had, the pictures are very clear the phone sound is very good and I like the QI charging and I can let it go without charging every day and I am checking things out all the time Very good battery. Bought the 256 GB I know I will never use all the storage But if I need it I've got it. If you are thinking of buying this phone I highly recommend it you won't be sorry",5,2018-05-12 02:30:00
"190","Apple nailed it","Apple products keep getting better in my opinion! I love the face id and the full screen, I dropped down from the plus size and I am so happy I did. The plus phone was just too big for me, I love how perfectly this phone fits in my hand, and I have all the screen I could need!",5,2018-11-28 17:03:00
"191","Good selection for latest IPhone","It takes some time to get use to learn all the functions. Love face resignation feature as compared to previous IPhone. I do not like the feature of reduced volume after you pick up phone to answer the phone. I have not figured out why my mail box is full thou I have ample storage space. I had to buy additional cloud space every month by paying $ 0.99 per month.",4,2019-03-20 22:13:00

"199","Awesome Phone!","I'm loving my new iPhone X! The facial recognition is fabulous!!! My only other desires would be for an additional fingerprint access option. I'd also like it to be just a little smaller, but it is still an ok size. The help at Best Buy was incredible! They took all the time I needed to explain everything there was to know about the phone! Thanks Best Buy!!!",5,2018-07-06 16:53:00

"204","Love the new features!","Face recognition works great- with or without glasses or a hat, even in the dark (by just the light of the screen) the technology recognizes me 99% of the time. Bigger screen is A++++. I couldn't give it 5 stars, however, until I figure out how to do the portrait manipulations with the camera that they showed off in the advertisements... not intuitive at all, so I guess I will have to google or wait for the IPhone guy on Facebook to post helpful hints in order to take advantage of the best aspects of the new camera. Still, picture quality is better than I was getting with the 6S. It only takes a few days to get used to the button-free features... but I was not happy to realize that I can't connect the phone to my car without some kind of bluetooth adaptor. I'll be heading back to best buy for that. Too expensive to just get a new car.",4,2017-11-19 20:19:00
"205","A very nice surprise!","My new iPhone X is great, and easier to use than my iPhone5! The swipe up was easy to adjust to, and the larger keyboard is such a help! Excellent camera, too! This 77 year old, tech-adverse grandma is very pleased!!!",5,2019-02-01 12:47:00
"206","Took a chance and don't regret it!","I was thinking of upgrading my 7 plus with iPhone 8 plus but decided to go for the X. I wasn't disappointed. Takes a while to get used to no home button, but now I don't miss it. I have been using wireless headphones for a while so who cares about the jack! Also, screen size is just as big as my 7 plus, but overall device is smaller. No regrets!",5,2018-07-13 12:37:00

"209","Great phone","I love this thing. I was hesitant to lose my home button, but I’ve now forgot what it was like to have one... faceID is slick and pretty accurate.

The battery live is a big improvement over our ageing iPhone 6s phones. I can actually get through the day without having to charge my phone at lunch, or run an external battery pack. We'll see how the batteries hold up over time though.",5,2017-12-15 14:56:00
"212","Quality phone","I love the gestures. I watched YouTube for some reminders. The guy at the store initially demonstrated them. My phone has many great, free apps.

"213","The upgrade I been waiting for!","I must admit, I am that guy that gets each new iPhone. They string me in every time! So being someone that has been through every version, I can honestly say this is my favorite iteration of the phone, ever. This is by far, the best iPhone! It’s fast, the screen is beautiful, and the facial recognition works amazingly. Many complain about that small bump that takes up real estate from the screen. It did bother me at first. After 2 weeks, I don’t seem to notice it anymore. My only complaint is the fingerprint reader unlocked everything faster. I didn’t even need to lift the phone. The facial recognition does work great, but you have to have your face right in front of it. I cant really consider that a flaw, seeing as that is what the phone intends to do. Overall, the phone is worth the money!",4,2017-12-20 19:05:00

"217","A revolutionary new type of phone","This phone is a revelation. With such a large screen in a small body it gives you plenty of space for content and apps, in a pocketable and hand-holdable size. Great cameras, especially in low-light.

"218","Three bears","This is my second iPhone X. It replaced my note 8 so now I have 2. I love the look and feel. The screen is awesome and I like the form factor. I came from a 7 plus and thought it was a little too big but this is just right. You take the 8, 8 plus and X and you have the perfect three bears scenario. One too big. One too small and one just right",5,2018-07-01 09:39:00

Nothing even comes close. Thank you Apple and Best Buy. So happy...",5,2018-02-23 12:25:00
"220","Feels like an android phone","When I decide to go with iPhone X I thought this phone would be better than my iphone 6 plus. The only reason I decide to buy iphone x is because my iphone 6 plus is acting up due to Apple's new IOS update. All the apps on my phone can barely load without the 5-10 seconds waiting time. Everyone of my friends I show how my iphone 6 plus act they were like this is worst than my 5 years old android phone. After using it for more than a month, nothing in this phone really makes me feel like it's a great phone. Major downsize what the screen, this is no 5.8"" screen to me. I hate watching Youtube with the screen blow up and having part of the screen get cut off. Watching it full size the screen are smaller than my iphone 6 plus. The only reason I am still using an iphone is that they have better security over any other smart phones in the market.",3,2018-04-03 21:08:00
"221","Great Phone","I've always liked apple iphones but, I'm glad i got this at a great price, Thanks Best Buy for the deals. 
Iphone X has lots of new features, no more bottons finger prints. It uses face recognition, for all my apps that requires password including payment. The screen is from top to bottom except where the front camera is.",5,2018-08-01 09:48:00

"225","Great phone all around","I love this iPhone X. Wasn't sure if I would like the face recognition, but I do. The one thing I do miss is that it doesn't show the remaining battery life by a percentage until you plug it in to charge it. The camera is excellent.",5,2018-12-21 19:40:00

"230","Love the form factor","Awesome, awesome phone. I love the screen and speed of the device. Face recognition works extremely well. I love how much smaller it is in your hand and pocket than the plus versions of previous models. My only annoyance is that I purchased it online without seeing it. The screen is stated to be bigger than the plus versions of the 6,7, and 8 but the phone is overall smaller because of the narrow bezels. While it technically is true, in the sense of diagonal inches, it is very narrow and tall, so the extra space is unusable. I came from a 7plus and while the screen was technically smaller diagonally, while using it, it felt larger. Because of the narrowness of the X screen, the keyboard is actually smaller than I was used to. All things considered though, great phone.",4,2017-12-04 14:28:00
"231","Awesome Phone, awesome screen!","I bought this phone practically when it first came out. I was hesitant to switch from the regular style iPhone to this new style. After much time with it and using all of my regular apps on it, I can say that I now prefer the no home button full-screen display over the old one. I love just now big the screen looks and with the button gone, I feel like its so much more modern. Thank you apple, best buy!",5,2018-02-15 12:56:00
"232","iPhone X does not disappoint","This is an upgrade from iPhone 5s. I finally had to give it up. I like the phone and all of it's functionality. The only thing it might take me awhile to get used to is not having the home button for fingerprint recognition. The face recognition is iffy at times. When I'm in a low light situation, it doesn't recognize me. I miss my fingerprint access. Other than that, it's a great phone and I don't expect anything less from Apple.",4,2018-12-02 08:49:00

She is now able to have the full size screen comparable to my larger 7 plus’s display screen without having to add the additional size of my 7 plus as compared to the 6 or 7 .

Works quickly and has yet to not work, even when it's dark out! I'm not missing a dedicated home button AT ALL. Swiping up is quicker and much easier to deal with especially if using the phone at the gym with sweaty hands(finger print never worked when i was working out). Go get one!",5,2017-11-28 15:00:00

Unfortunately, mine arrived missing the headphone jack and a home button but other than that it was perfect. Battery life is decent, navigating around the phone is fine once you get used to it. Overall I like it but I’ll definitely be ready to get rid of it in a year. I’m a sucker for new technology.",5,2018-01-26 19:56:00

It has been different in some ways but once you figure out the differences from an earlier iPhone version to the X, it is quite easy. It has many extras you don't hear about and thus it was worth getting a tutorial from an apple rep.",5,2018-02-21 10:08:00

From how fast the processor to the video quality and apps. Only thing is, it's not as big as the Samsung Galaxy Note 8. It's like Apple is always one behind on the size of the phone. I can't wait for the X Plus to arrive!",5,2018-01-16 15:54:00

I like the feel and features given by this iPhone X. Face detection is awesome (works in dark as well). Entire phone is your screen and hence, some of the functionality got change. But it only take one day to get used to it. 
Overall - excellent upgrade for me.",5,2017-12-04 08:06:00

"262","so far so good","This was an upgrade for my teenage son. So far he is really enjoying the phone, even considering he switched from android. It is a good size and takes great pictures.

"267","A great phone","I switched over from a galaxy note 8 for one reason I didn’t want my data sold. Apple as far as I know it’s pretty strict about selling your data to advertisers. They make money selling you expensive stuff . I liked the galaxy eight a little better but this one is pretty close , it just take some interesting getting used to swipe gestures and everything. almost perfect couple things they could improve such as key combinations and things like that but it works really wel. the screen is beautiful and the integration with other Apple products works well.",4,2018-06-20 19:23:00

To be honest, I don't know if it really charges slow or if it is because she is on it all the time. She listens to music via blue tooth, face times with her friends etc. and all works wonderfully. So not sure if the battery charges slowly or not. That's her only complaint.

Having a screen larger then the plus that fits in your hand feels amazing and really does feel like the future. You don’t really notice the notch - and the best part is the bar at the bottom that lets you quickly switch between apps. Trust me this is the phone you need to buy - not an 8.",5,2018-03-09 08:24:00

"297","Great iPhone, Amazing Phone","This phone is absolutely fantastic. Coming from an iPhone 7, this phone is blazing fast and incredibly beautiful with its high resolution 5.8” OLED display. I have no complaints at all with this phone and quite frankly I can’t believe this is an iPhone. Definitely recommend to anyone and everyone.",5,2018-06-22 15:47:00
"298","Amazing phone!","Been an iPhone fan for years. Upgraded to this from the iPhone 5.

"304","Intuitive","Of all the upgrades to the iPhone X, none are more impressive than the camera features. I purchased this a little early specifically for a family vacation and the pictures/video were nothing short of professional. As my grandson said, I could have spent twice as much on a professional camera and gotten poorer quality pictures.",5,2018-04-18 18:52:00
"305","Great phone!","Great phone.  Big improvement over iPhone 7. Love the speed and the camera!",5,2019-06-29 09:20:00
"306","Unexpectedly Great!","My last phone was an iPhone 7 Plus. It costs. me about $960.00 so the price on this was not necessarily an issue. I was disappointed in the iPhone X design when it was unveiled and the price was pretty daunting. However, I was pleasantly surprised. After a very short time I no longer noticed the notch and, as much of a sceptic as I was, the Face ID is really cool.",5,2018-01-23 12:43:00

"309","I absolutely love this phone","This phone is just fabulous. I don't miss the home button at all. The facial recognition doesn't work as perfectly as I had hoped, but I am still giving it 5 stars. You just have to be sure the phone is held up and aimed right at your face. I feel it is highly over priced really, but then again, it is a great product. I wouldn't consider any other phone but an iPhone.",5,2018-01-10 22:01:00
"310","FANTASTIC!","I was hesitant about spending the money for the X, but figured I use my phone more than any other device in life, so might as well splurge. This thing is fantastic. The facial recognition log in is excellent - I don't even think about the phone pulling up at all any more. It just opens. Battery life is excellent as well as speed. Good job Apple and good deal Best Buy.",5,2018-01-08 20:58:00
"311","Very Nice iPhone","Loving the iPhone X, jailbroken on iOS 12.1.1 beta, this phone is nice and fast!!!!",5,2019-06-15 09:18:00

"321","Nice phone","I'm not an Apple fan but I have to give credit where it is due. Bought this phone for my daughter - graduation gift. Built really well and has a smooth and efficient OS. Only negative is pricing. It could be a little less expensive. Certainly a great gift for a deserving child ; )",5,2018-07-07 09:01:00
"322","First IPhone in 10 years","I have been an avid Android user, I hated the first 2 iPhones I had, I switched to Android and never looked back. I took a risk when I decided to take a chance on this phone, I have NOT been disappointed!",5,2018-11-28 17:01:00
"323","Great phone","The iPhone X is a great upgrade to the iPhone. The increased use of space for the screen makes the screen looks beautiful. The facial recognition works flawlessly, and the phone is the perfect size.

"325","iPhone X","I have loved every iPhone I have owned since my first 4s ! That being said they are getting too pricey & although I love the added security of apple products I’m not sure they are worth it anymore in relation to new features offered. Last two I owned I felt the value for price paid just isn’t there when you compare to comparable android models. First time I’m giving an iffy review of an apple product ever.",4,2018-10-21 01:59:00
"326","Close to perfect","The iPhone X is a beautiful phone. The new oled display is beautiful, going edge to edge and with a notch at the top. Some may not like the notch, but you get used to it. Apple FINALLY releases wireless charging into an iPhone, so this is nice. The phone has a premium feel with the stainless steel frame, and glass back. Face ID is a nice concept, but I’d rather have a finger print reader on the back. If you place your phone down on a table you’ll find yourself leaning over to get into view for the Face ID to work. Besides that the only complaint I have is the price of the phone.",4,2018-03-16 18:04:00
"327","Nice size","Love my new iPhone. It does everything i need in s phone.",5,2019-07-17 17:17:00
"328","Good phone and not hetty","Bought this phone for my friend who has recently come to USA. I personally use Samsung Galaxy Note 8. The phone becomes slow at times. My wife use iPhone X and I was amazed to see the performance. Except camera, I believe rest of the phone is far better than Samsung Galaxy Note 8. Awesome product.",5,2018-05-27 05:34:00
"329","Love my X!","It was a hard sell because I was afraid of losing the home button, but I’m so glad I did it! I love this iPhone so much! It was so easy to learn and now I’ll never go back!",5,2019-01-17 16:53:00

"331","Favorite iPhone in a long time","First time in years and years that a new iPhone feels like a NEW phone. Love it. Very easy to adjust to the lack of a home button. No headphone jack which can be irritating",5,2019-01-16 19:27:00
"332","Amazing","I upgraded from the iPhone 6s Plus. So far the battery is fantastic the speed is second to none. I I was skeptical about the facial unlock verses the fingerprint but I have to say I prefer the facial unlock over the fingerprint. No need to worry about taking your gloves off in the winter to unlock your iPhone! It’s amazing and I would highly recommend it.",5,2018-01-09 21:49:00
"333","Best iPhone Yet","I replaced my iPhone 6s Plus with the X. It took a little bit to get used to the removal of the home button, but now I love it. The Face ID works great except when I am laying in bed at night. The camera is truly better than any camera I have ever owned. Apple fan for life.",5,2018-07-08 10:48:00
"334","Great phone if you only want the best","I had an iPhone 5S until earlier this year. I decided to try the Samsung Galaxy 8. After 5 months, I decided to trade it in for the iPhone X. It is so much better. Much easier to use Apple CarPlay than android auto with both of my chevys. Alexa is also easier to use than Bixby.",5,2018-06-29 18:52:00
"335","My new iPhone X","I am delighted with my new iPhone X. I looked at it in March but did not purchase it, however, last week I decided to look at it again and I bought it. It is easy to use and has a lot a nice features, some of which I haven't even toyed with yet. All in all, I am glad I bought it.",5,2018-06-22 15:19:00
"336","Smooth phone","As an iPhone user for many years I can say this version is good as most of the upgrades are, the only thing is that most apps still don’t have support for the faceid and loops themselves sometimes & if your life is attached to having a home button you’re going to crazy the 1st weeks trying to get used to it, so overall is good..: expensive but good",5,2018-01-17 17:52:00
"337","iOS is the best","I have had an iPhone ever since the very first model has come out. They are easy to use and can do so much and are capable of a multitude of things.",5,2019-02-20 20:30:00
"338","Simply the BEST!","Upgraded from a 6 Plus and there is no comparison! I think skipping an upgrade cycle makes the technological improvements quite a bit more noticeable. Face recognition is working very well, I'm working on multiple self photos so I can fire up the phone while wearing sunglasses!",5,2018-06-23 09:04:00
"339","A perfect upgrade","This phone has all the cool features Apple is known for. The size is perfect, especially since the screen i larger than my outgoing 7+. The Face ID takes some getting used to after years of fingerprint security.

The processor is super fast too.",5,2018-08-24 17:51:00
"340","New phone (a while ago)","When these first came out however many months ago, my husband would have no rest until we got them. So we did. They are nice. A little bit big, but otherwise nice. Sorry for the crazy late review.",5,2018-11-28 20:57:00

"346","Memojis are hilarious!","At first I wasn't impressed. Unlocking with my face seemed like a gimmick (and kind of still is), but the Memojis are so fun. I needed an upgrade and got this on Sprint's upgrade deal.",5,2018-12-19 02:14:00
"347","Best Upgrade","Coming from the 7, this is an upgrade in battery life, screen space, and hard disk space. One of the better iPhones yet IMO.",5,2019-03-30 02:06:00

"349","Best iPhone Ever","I had bought the iPhone 8 Plus thinking their might be some major issues considering this was a big redesign not just for the hardware but the UI software as well. Man was I completely wrong and thank goodness my stepdaughter had an upgrade due. This phone is amazing and the new UI is great. Very fluid motions and beautiful screen. A must buy for a tech lover.",5,2017-12-08 16:51:00
"350","Great new iPhone and easy to operate","iPhone is same except for no buttons now on the iPhone 10 X instead u swipe to do everything now. It took a minute but now I’m used to it and like it way better.",5,2019-01-25 22:40:00
"351","Huge upgrade from previous years IPhones.","It’s an excellent phone, fast and sleek. I love the full screen, but it was a good week to get used to no button on the bottom.",5,2019-03-23 08:15:00
"352","Best camera yet","My wife loves her new iPhone she bought it for the camera and it didn’t disappoint. Battery life is about two days with no charge",5,2018-01-27 09:46:00
"353","Best iPhone Yet!","It was a little difficult to get used to the iPhone X for the first day or two, but I absolutely love the new technology and especially the new camera and its features!

"354","iPhone X","Apple products are great for the most part. A little pricey, but that’s nothing new. I love the sleek design of this phone, the sound is amazing and it takes fabulous photos. I think that it has as much memory as the first computer that I ever owned, maybe more! But it is so much faster! HaHa!",5,2018-05-12 13:02:00
"355","love my new phone","I love my new phone just having a hard time with out the start button",5,2019-06-21 20:14:00
"356","The most advanced iPhone yet","I ordered this on the first day and it arrived in only 1 week. I had an issue when paying for the phone at the store but I won't hold that against the iPhone. I really like the size and got used to the new changes very quickly. I would say go for the iPhone 8 or X depending on what the current price and your preference is. You will be happy with either one.",5,2017-12-11 22:32:00
"357","Great phone","Good camera quality, overall very satisfied with purchase.",5,2019-07-07 21:48:00
"358","Great iPhone for the new upgrade","I got the black iPhone X and I really love how simple this iPhone is versus the different iPhone X that there are now. Just like the iPhone 8 plus except the face recognition and fullscreen",5,2018-12-05 14:53:00
"359","It's an Iphone","Aside from all the fancy new features and bezeless display, it is an iPhone with IOS11. You can probably get the same features in the iPhome 8 and save a few bucks. The X is a lot smaller than I thought it would be so keep that in mind if you are coming from a larger phone.",4,2017-12-23 16:22:00
"360","New phone","Battery life is good. Phone works great. I washed my last one, bought on Best Buy and picked up later that day. Doesn’t get more easy than that.",5,2019-02-20 21:51:00
"361","great self portrait camera","The portrait feature can now be used for selfies and there’s new filters to go with it. I love the stage lighting filter. It blacks out everything around you and makes you look like a giant sticker placed on a black background.",5,2017-11-17 08:55:00
"362","Beautiful","Got this for my sister in law for her upgrade with AT&T. I always upgrade with bestbuy. They are so much easier to deal with then the actual phone service retail associates. 

We got her the silver and it looks beautiful. I cant stop staring at it.",5,2018-08-08 07:50:00
"363","Great so far","I have only had the phone for about two weeks now. But so far no problems at all. The battery with me using it a lot last’s around 8 hours. That’s with my Apple Watch paired to it also.",5,2018-04-06 12:31:00

"366","Best iPhone yet!","I purchased the iPhone X even though I heard reviews of it not being worth the money. I absolutely love this phone.

"375","iPhone X","iPhone X is a wonderful device. It was a bit cumbersome for me to figure out how to do all the other things I used to on my previous iPhones but the Best Buy Mobile staff is the best. They took time to explain all the features I had questions about....and well, candidly, YouTube taught me more stuff. :) Buy iPhone X",5,2018-03-09 16:06:00

"378","Great. Best iPhone yet.","Bought this for my wife. We’ve owned many iPhones and this one has the best screen by far. The lack of home button is not missed. We’ve done comparisons by playing the same movie at the same time on the iPhone X and a iPhone 7plus and the X’s screen is so much better. The cameras are the best too.",5,2018-04-18 17:36:00

"380","Nice phone","Iphone X is a nice phone but takes some getting used to with no home button and having to use facial recognition or pass code.

Overall im very happy with the size and speed and would buy it again.",5,2018-03-30 21:22:00
"381","Slick and nice large screen","The iPhone X is a choice unit. To match the Samsung, they expanded the screen to cover the whole unit and it's pretty sweet. Resolution is unreal; very crisp and clear. However, it also shows smudges a lot more than the previous models, but that's a small price to pay for an overall nice phone!",5,2018-04-19 08:35:00

"383","Love it","I was very skeptical at first on buying my iPhone X but after having it for a couple weeks, I absolutely love it. I upgraded from an iPhone 6s So this is a big jump for me but highly recommend it for everybody else. If you have an iPhone 7 or 8 do not upgrade. It would seem worthless for you.",5,2018-04-21 19:29:00
"384","Love It","Bought this upgrade for my wife. It has a slight learning curve due to the different/updated features from her previous iPhone, but she loves it!",5,2019-02-09 04:24:00
"385","Very Good","I love my new phone! Upgraded from an iPhone7 so no more home button but now I have to swipe up. It’s all about that swiping game now. Should’ve waited to get the iPhoneXS Max though..",5,2018-11-30 08:40:00

Way to expensive for what you get.",5,2018-11-29 05:52:00

"388","Great device, bit expensive","I bought it for my son going to college. I could have waited a few days to buy the latest version however my son didn’t care for the “improvements” in the newer version. Besides this was cheaper by $100. He loves it.",5,2018-09-28 17:39:00
"389","It’s an iPhone !!! Need I say more","It’s not perfect but then again, it comes pretty close to it. Closer then anyone else. Love it.

Small learning curve with the new gestures but very easy to get used to and within the first few hours you’ll feel at home with it. Recommend.",5,2017-12-29 19:15:00
"390","Best phone ever","The IPhone X is my first iPhone having been a longtime Android user. This phone pushed me to switch and I could not be happier. This is by far my favorite phone ever and could not be happier with the ease of use, features and functionalities.",5,2018-08-05 12:31:00
"391","Love my Phone!!","This iPhone is wonderful! I love the Face ID and the larger screen. I previously had an iPhone 6 Plus, so the change in the device size is a welcome one. The camera is AH-Mazing! The OLED screen is also a nice feature. Videos show very well. It’s easy to adjust to not having a home button. I don’t miss it at all! I would definitely recommend the purchase!",5,2017-11-10 13:06:00
"392","IphoneX","I have wanted this phone for a long time. Best Buy has a great deal on it so I bought it. I have had 2 iPhones before this one. It is a great phone; love the camera on it!!",5,2018-12-19 17:30:00
"393","Surprised","Didn’t think I’d like the Face ID but it works well. The size of the phone is better than the previous model and the sound and video is a huge improvement.",5,2019-01-19 08:36:00
"394","Love it","Didn’t think I’d like the Face ID but it works well. The size of the phone is better than the previous model and the sound and video is a huge improvement.",5,2019-01-19 08:37:00
"395","Great phone","Great phone to replace my iPhone 6. Love the Face ID, but sometimes miss the finger ID. Much faster than my old phone, and once you get used to how to navigate without the home button, it’s a breeze!",5,2018-10-29 15:55:00
"396","Love my new phone!","Upgrades are always nice! Definitely nice going from a 7 to a X!",5,2019-06-19 03:16:00
"397","Excellent","Very fast and easy to use. No problems with this unit",5,2019-07-05 15:13:00
"398","Great!","I've really enjoyed this phone since day one. It took about a day for the learning curve without a home button, but now it is second nature. I replaced a Galaxy S8+ that was buggy and crashed all the time. This phone takes great pics, has excellent battery life, and has worked flawlessly without crashing once. Great investment!",5,2018-01-17 17:40:00
"399","So fast and easy to use","I didn’t think it would be any different. I had the iPhone 7Plus and I loved it and didn’t want to leave it, but once I saw how beautiful the iPhone X was I immediately fell in love with its aesthetic features and its size. It’s smaller yet bigger screen.",5,2018-07-06 13:08:00
"400","Best. iPhone I ever owned","This iPhone is the best yet I have owned just about every version of the iphone very few dropped calls but that is because of the service in the area,Verizon is putting up a mini tower in back of my house which I think will stop the dropped calls",5,2018-07-25 07:55:00
"401","Great phone","The battery last all day and the pictures are true and vibrant.",5,2019-06-19 20:08:00
"402","Amazing phone","Great phone to use. Picture quality awesome. Really enjoying it",5,2019-06-19 19:39:00
"403","Face recognition doesn’t always work","Face recognition doesn’t always work. It’d be much more helpful if the thumbprint option would pop up. Having to type in a password is still a bit of a nuisance, but I appreciate the fact that it still works with sunglasses on. Also, face recognition works in the dark, sometimes. The way to fully close apps takes additional steps versus swiping up on other iPhones. It’s not exactly a smooth transition from the other iphones. Does take a lot of getting used to. Camera quality is great, but I would recommend sticking to the iPhone 8 for the price.",4,2018-02-25 08:30:00
"404","Happy Iphone X owner","At first, I wasn't sure about this product due to the price. But, after doing some research I came to the conclusion that the functionality of this device justifies the price. Once again Apple delivered an excellent product.",5,2018-09-07 14:00:00
"405","Favorite iPhone","This is by far my favorite iPhone and I’ve had almost all of them since the 4. The face recognition is the best feature",5,2019-03-20 17:48:00
"406","Love it!","I have small hands so having the larger phones is hard for me to hold with just one hand. And I can’t be holding my phone with two hands all the time! This phone is a great size compromise for holding and the screen is the winning number! Goes out to the edges!",5,2018-06-20 17:59:00
"407","Glass Protector","I higher recommend the glass protector for your phone. It’s so clear that you can not notice it on the phone but it protects the screen from breaking and it has a lifetime warranty",5,2018-11-30 23:09:00
"408","Great product","Versatile phone equipped with all the features you need to stay connected on the go.",5,2019-05-16 08:17:00

"410","Best IPhone Ever!!!!!","The smart phone on steroids!!! Oled screen is awesome! Camera is bad to the bone! And to top it all off besides the facial recognition and fast processor, huge viewing screen!!! I’m a iPhone geek for life!!!",5,2017-12-15 20:15:00

"414","Pleased","I’ve had the phone for a while now and overall it is a good product. Not sure if I like the facial recognition better or the fingerprint recognition from my last phone better. Takes great pictures.",4,2019-05-16 06:23:00
"415","My girlfriend really liked this phone!","My girlfriend thought this phone was light years ahead of her old iPhone 7. It has so many features, she probably won't find all of them by the time she thinks this phone is out of date.",5,2018-11-16 16:10:00
"416","Amazing features","In love with all the new features! Only thing that can be annoying is if you have face id set up and look at the phone after a missed call, it automatically calls them back. Don’t have a single complaint about the phone & so glad they did away with the home button",5,2018-06-08 15:58:00
"417","Great camera","This was such a step up. Love the portrait feature. An incredible phone. I do miss the button but I have adjusted. I also miss the fingerprint scanner instead of face recognition.",5,2018-11-28 17:42:00
"418","This iPhone is great!","I’ve been a huge Apple fan for a long time and this by far is one of my favoreites. I usually get the plus models but decided to try something a little more pocketable and I now am in love with the size and feel of this phone. As for Face ID, it has definitely grown on me.",5,2018-05-17 02:39:00
"419","iPhone X","So far it’s great except for only having it for less than a week and the face recognition stopped working and I had to get the phone replaced. Other than that I love all the new features it has that the other iPhones don’t.",5,2018-09-01 11:37:00
"420","Amazing phone","Upgraded from the 6 plus and boy am I glad! Fyi, you don’t need to setup Face ID if you don’t want to! You can still do swipe up to unlock and punch in your password and voila! Great alternative for those that don’t like having to set up Face ID and having your face stored somewhere.",5,2018-04-20 16:57:00
"421","Good Phone But Pricey","Ive had an Android phone of over 20 years and the iPhone X is my first Apple phone. Its a bit of a learning curve but I love Apple products in general and expect to love this phone as well as time goes by. The only thing I prefer with the Android phones over the iPhone is the adjustabbility of the main screen (which is really not a big deal). I gave the 4 stars review because I haven't had enough time yet to see all the pros and cons.",4,2018-07-21 11:39:00
"422","Great camera and screen","Good purchase and I recommend to everyone to enjoy",5,2019-07-05 16:37:00
"423","Big Screen on a Small Phone","I love the bigger screen of the iPhone X while maintaining the small phone size. The camera is awesome, and the features it offers are great. I was hesistant about no home button, but I have come to love that and the facial recognition to unlock the phone.",5,2018-06-22 17:38:00
"424","Sister sister","Love sisters reaction to see her new iPhone X.  OMG :-0",5,2019-06-27 18:44:00
"425","This iPhone X is AMAZING","I wasn't sure I wanted this new phone until I was having trouble with my 7,but the retina scanning is the most amazing this I have seen in a while. It really works well and is so hassle free when it comes to using the phone. This is jus one of the many features I love, the other is the sharpness of the new camera. Well done Apple!",5,2017-12-21 17:27:00
"426","Gift for my girls","Best Buy is the best place to buy phones, the girls love these devices. Very high quality, Apple is always pricey, but they hold there resale value better than any other phone.",5,2018-11-30 13:18:00
"427","Best iPhone to date","I've been an Android guy for nine years waiting for it to be worth it to switch. It would take a lot of features to compete with the customization available from an Android. And the iPhone X is jam-packed with features. Seamless integration with my iPad and Macbook Pro also helped me make the jump.",5,2018-03-09 13:09:00
"428","iPhone x","Love this phone. The screen is vibrant, good battery life, don’t miss the home button. Only issue I have is I take a lot of screen shots trying to adjust the volume.",5,2018-12-19 23:29:00
"429","Wow and wow","Got this for my wife and she absolutely loves it. Has more than enough space for all her pictures and videos. She loves the camera as the pictures are beautiful. It's an iPhone and that's all that needs to be said.",5,2018-09-14 17:12:00
"430","Nice","I want to love this phone, but I've had nothing but problems since the moment I got it. I upgraded from an iPhone 6s. I've had more problems with this brand new X than I did with the old 6s and Apple can't even figure out why!!!!! GRRR....Even Verizon has tried to help. They, Apple, made a couple of stupid changes, but a lot of nice changes as well.",4,2018-11-07 00:58:00
"431","Bigger the better?","A friend ordered it this time! More storage space definitely helps, and silver/white color looks good too. Working well till now. 
I think price is still a con. Thanks again to the offers from Best Buy and Sprint.",4,2018-04-19 18:54:00

"441","Great Phone","If you have an Iphone you already know the quality. The hype was a little much, it did take a little while to get used to the new screen with no home button, screen gestures and case size (came from a 7+) but got used to it quickly. if you're not sure how something works definitely google and YouTube it.",5,2018-02-15 13:31:00

"443","Love the Portrait Mode","Although my iPhone 6 was 3 years old, I mainly bought this iPhoneX because of the amazing camera features. The portrait mode is excellent and so easy to use, with beautiful results. It took a little while to learn how to close apps and shut down open apps, but now it's a breeze.",5,2018-04-19 09:01:00
"444","Great phone","Got a great lease deal through sprint, so the upgrade was worth it. Face Id isnt quite as smooth as they make it seem, but still works most if the time. Not sure if I'd upgrade over the 7 or 8 if it was full price, but it is a great phone",5,2018-07-20 16:56:00
"445","Great iPhone","Best iPhone yet , works great, would highly recommend to purchase",5,2019-06-07 16:35:00

"449","iPhone X - Face recognition is a blast!","I've only had my iPhone X for 10 days now but I'm truly enjoying getting to know the phone. Most iPhones don't offer a whole lot from generation to generation. This is the first one that feels like it truly evolved. The Face ID is quite cool. I'm still trying to figure out which third-party apps work and which do not. The True Depth camera is amazing and that alone is worth picking up this beauty. The real issue is the price. Not sure if Apple will ever offer a price reduction but paying monthly installments over 2 years is not the worst option to bring this phone home today!",4,2017-12-08 12:29:00
"450","Love it!!!","I love my iPhone X! Bought it after playing with my husband;s phone. So glad I did. The pictures are outstanding. Facial recognition is great.Learning new features everyday.",5,2018-11-29 07:14:00
"451","Apple all the way","This iPhone is what they should have been all along. Losing the home button isn’t bad at all and the facial scan is more convenient than the finger scanner once used to it. Screen is fed better than led models and size is bigger than the plus I had.",5,2018-06-23 21:36:00

"455","Great","Pros

Stunning screen
Much-improved telephoto camera
The best-looking iPhone ever

Face ID is so much better than a fingerprint sensor
Cons

Software needs more optimisation for the taller display and notch
No fast-charging plug included
Very expensive",5,2018-03-23 12:54:00
"456","Nice phone","I have had no problems with this whatsoever. Of course it’s about time to upgrade to the next one. It is heavier than all other iPhones I’ve had.",5,2019-01-16 17:36:00

"463","iPhone X","Love the smaller size of the overall phone and yet still bigger display than my previous two plus’s the lack of a home button took a little getting use to but now it begs the question why apple didn’t do this sooner!",5,2018-08-24 12:34:00
"464","Best iPhone yet","Love this phone. It’s smaller then my 7plus but I really don’t notice much difference. The Face ID thing doesn’t work most of the time for me.

"468","Awesome phone","This phone takes a little getting used to but is awesome. Not having the home button makes for less chances of the button breaking like it did on my last iPhone. Taking photos is a snap and they come out picture perfect.",5,2018-08-13 17:26:00

"471","Next gen stuff!!","I have been an iPhone user since 3G to include all the Plus iPhones, yes I had the 8 Plus. All I can say is this phone is incredible!

"512","iPhone X","I have had it for a couple of weeks now after switching from an IPhone 7 Plus. There isn’t a lot of change from the 7 with the exception of the closing of the apps and Face ID. I prefer the closing process of the 7 over the X. The Face ID is ok as long as you aren’t wearing sunglasses. Sometimes it will work with the glasses on and sometimes it won’t. I’m hopeful that they come out with a larger sized X since this one is a little smaller than I care for.",4,2018-04-28 11:00:00

"526","excellent speed and camera","very fast processing, excellent pictures and screen, deceivingly large screen. I went from a 7 to the X, it is a bit larger and harder to handle with one hand, but the trade offs for the quality of phone are worth it.",5,2018-07-20 09:25:00
"527","Apple phonetic","Got two of these for my teenagers and now I am the Best Mom in the world.

"529","No denying this is an amazing phone","The notch, does it bother me? Absolutely not.

"530","Worth It","The iPhone X is worth it. Both my brothers have it. I did a lot of research to find out if it was worth the extra money. I upgraded from the iPhone 6s.

"535","It’s good not great","With the iPhone X you have to be an Apple person to make logical sense to overpay for this phone. Some upgrades but it’s really not that impressive for the money you spend on it and knowing that Apple always has a phone coming out and doing tweaking upgrades. If your not an Apple lover and your phone is not smashsed there are better options. I was contemplating returning mine within the return policy everyday and since I’m an Apple person and not broke am rolling with it.",4,2018-03-16 11:25:00
"536","Big fan of iPhones","I am a bit biased because I really like iPhones vs Android. I have had both and I like to be able th Sync to all my other Apple devices.

"541","It’s ok","I really wanted to love this phone and I think it is still great. However, for the price tag I was hoping to feel more comfortanle with.

"542","I love this phone","Most of the front of the phone being the display screen is a great new feature.

"550","Great IPhone X","I went into Best Buy knowing what phone I wanted, As I always do research about what I want when it’s an investment the store wasn’t busy at all due do the large amount of snow we’d gottten so upgrade my phone was a painless process, the associate who helped me out was good.",5,2018-02-13 07:10:00

"554","Oh my...","My wife was very excited about upgrading to the iPhone X as her sister has one as well. The features of the phone are as she wanted, however, within 2 weeks there was bright green line on the screen so we took it to an APPLE store. They had to send it out to be fixed. When it was ready to be picked up we found that they had just sent her a new phone, that should have been the first warning. Now after owning the phone for a little over 4 months the battery is failing. It shows 100%, but unexpectedly shuts off. When you try to turn it on it says that the battery is low. After plugging it in and the phone turns on it shows that the battery is at 100%...Taking it in (again) to be fixed. For the cost of this device you think it would last longer.",3,2019-01-04 21:49:00

"573","It takes some getting used to. Still no aux jack.","It takes some getting used to, but once you're used to it the iPhone X is great. This current has some of the best processors on a cell phone to where everything performs fast and efficient. The only thing you'll have to worry about performing slow is where and what you're connected to in terms of internet and service provider. Still no headphone jack which is very disappointing.

"746","Excellent product","The phone is great and well built. The screen has good color though I'd say Samsung's recent phones have a slight edge here. The camera is phenomenal for a phone and there are some really good photography tools. Animojis are pretty cool and will make non iPhone x people jealous. I took one star off because the notch on the screen is annoying, Apple still hasn't allowed expandable memory and the included earphones are very uncomfortable.",4,2017-12-15 15:12:00

"808","Wow! But it takes getting used to.","All in all a great pocket computer. There are a few things which take getting used to, but nothing I’d consider a dealbreaker. App developers haven’t yet fully embraced the design to allow for the notch, but I’m sure they’ll catch up. Meanwhile the workaround is to simply flip the phone and you can use hidden buttons. FaceID leaves a bit to be desired, I don’t always want to assume the position to open my phone.",4,2017-12-29 00:38:00

"839","From Samsung To Apple","Simple to use my iPhone X, of course there is a bit of a learning curve since I haven't owned one since the 5s.

"1103","Not Too Sure Yet","Im honestly not very impressed with this phone. I was under the impression Apple was designing this phone with the ability to essentially be used as a computer, with connectivity to a keyboard and display. This is not a feature I would use often or is of great importance, but it is innovation and could help support the price of this.

Additionally, why make this in all glass? (Aside from the fact that it will boost accessory sales as well as repair revenue).

This phone still acts glitchy and I got the unlocked version with 256GB memorory. The unlocked version has 4GB of RAM vs the traditional iPhone X models (Carrier Specifict Models). You can research this to confirm if you doubt this is correct.

I am at the point where I might just return the phone and either choose another alternative such as the Google2 phone or the BlackBerry KeyOne.

My life is cluttered enough, sometimes getting back to basics is most important. Especially when the difference in price is $700.00!",3,2017-12-23 14:18:00

"1576","Expensive phone that lacks some features","The phone is nice looking. However, you would think that the features that are important would be priority. Well first of all the head buds for this phone doesn't match the cost. They should be wireless. Also, the fact that when restoring the phone from backup settings from your old device all the custom ringtones are deleted and not transferred over. Also, the call screen when in a call is a lil annoying when the screen goes asleep and wakes up and say you want to multitask so you have to swipe up from the bottom.... may accidentally end the call your on by hitting the end button.. these are just a few of the things that should be address for such and expensive phone Apple!

"1625","Gimmicky.","So Apple finally decided to redesign the iPhone and this is the result. I give them props for the overall look at the phone as well as finally upgrading the screen technology and adding wireless charging. However the gestures are not intuitive and face ID does not work nearly as well as they say it does unless you disable The required attention feature which makes the phone less secure. With this feature turned on it only works one in every five or six trials for me. It was a massive mistake for them to illuminate touch ID. If they were going to go all screen on the front that’s fine. But they should have put a fingerprint reader on the back of the phone like the rest of the industry. Hopefully they will rectify this in the second generation next year.",3,2018-01-20 00:20:00

So you can look at your camera and make animal emojis mimic your movements which was fun for a day or two, but that was that. I don’t see that much improvement on the camera either, supposedly it’s the best camera on a phone but I’ve seen the new Samsung galaxy 9 and the camera there surpasses this one. I wish I would have waited for the Samsung galaxy 9 because if your going to spend this much money on a phone then it should be a phone you should feel happy about purchasing instead of “I wish” I would have waited for the new droid.",3,2018-03-05 11:38:00

Gets hung up and freezes when trying to text more than one image, then again freezes for no reason at all! Open camera to take pic and there's just a blurry screen- again must close out and reopen, often several times! (Forget getting that spontaneous shot!) I got rid of my 6S thinking some of the occasional hiccups were due to its age-I should've kept it! Kept hoping updates would correct issues, they haven't and I see no online fixes. Did online chat w/Apple to make appt at local Apple Store and was told they currently have no iPhone appts available!!! (Looking 3 weeks out- Unbelievable.)

"2699","Best iPhone yet","I’ve had almost every iPhone in the past and before this had the iPhone 7 Plus 128gb black. This phone is amazing. The screen is stunning and new features are a nice change. For the first few hours it can be quite a change navigating the new gestures of your a previous iPhone user but you quickly start t adopt to the new gestures quite easily. The sound is much better, wireless charging is a quite usable feature and yes animojis are quite fun. Face ID is great but the extra swipe in the beginning is a little taxing. Hopefully more apps will integrate Face ID from Touch ID as I have had to enter passwords where I previously used Touch ID as that is not an option as of yet. So in conclusion the iPhone X feels like an actual upgrade compared to the past of a few new features not a new phone. It’s defiantly worth the purchase as it is quite enjoyable.",5,2017-11-04 07:19:00

"3130","iPhone X Defect","My iPhone X expierence so far. Preordered on Oct. 27th and managed to get a Gray/Black 256GB Iphone X. Finally arrives on the 6th and I don’t get a chance to open it up and attempt to hook up my new phone until the 11th. So here I go beaming with excitement to check out my new device that just cost me the equivalent of a house payment. Open it up and everything looks good at first and then I use my iPhone 6S light to look at the screen for any dust as I’ve already gotten a screen protector in hand to put on my new device before I even get started. Then I see it. A very very small scratch or crack under the screen coming from the notch area at the top of the phone coming down maybe 1/2 a cm long. So I schedule an appointment to talk to an Apple rep. for 8:45am and he finally calls me at 8:48am. I explain to him what I observed on my phone and he doesn’t seem to thrilled to help me out today. Maybe because it’s a Saturday and he’s at work. During our conversation he makes a statement that I didn’t really care for. Such as... Maybe the delivery man dropped your package and maybe that’s what happened. Obviously this is a manufacturing defect since it’s under the screen. So I get two options. Option A) Send my phone in to be repaired and who knows how long that will take and why would I want a brand new item I just paid a lot of money for to be repaired due to a defect. Option B) Go to the Apple Store and have them look at it and I can try and request a new phone. Oh and the next available time I can get an appointment is 4 days away and I’ll have to take off work early to resolve an Apple manufacturing defect. So I guess we will see how my Apple Store experience goes. I’ve had an Apple phone going back to the 3GS days and I’ve dealt with Apple Customer Service in the past with no issues but so far I’d have to say I’m extremely disappointed in the quality control of the IPhone X and the customer service expierence with Apple. Hopefully all is redeemed on the 14th. To be continued...",1,2017-11-11 08:51:00
