1,great phone,"Great phone as expected for the latest iPhone , got it for the wife and she has no complains about it.",5,1/21/20 13:08
2,Best iPhone yet,"Simplicity meets need.
One rugged price of equipment.
Still has the same kinks like the face unlock doesn’t work when your driving Or at an angle and people will see u putting in your passcode If it doesn’t work.
These are easy fixes. It could use multi tasking otherwise the best speedy  and beautiful.
Too expensive .",4,10/18/19 17:04
3,This iphone takes great picturesIt takes time to g,"It takes a little time to get use to this iPhone, because it no longer have the home button you have to swipe.",5,10/22/19 07:07
4,Fantastic camera,I love the pictures this phone takes. It met the mark on almost every level.,5,10/18/19 15:30
5,Very good camera and battery,Loving this iPhone it’s pretty good quality and the battery is very good as well my phone stays pretty much changed all day,5,10/29/19 23:42
6,Cameras!,This phone is amazing and so user friendly. The images it captures at night are spectacular.,5,10/14/19 16:05
7,Great overall,"I love the camera, is fun and when recording it’s awesome!!!!!",5,10/12/19 11:55
8,The phone keep crashing,The constantly crash so planning on return it before my 14 days expored to get another one,1,10/5/19 07:29
9,Great value dollar per dollar!!!,"This new iPhone separated itself from the rest, is lighter, it feels right on the hand. The transition from a physical button to a digital operation is painless.
I will recommend this iPhone to anyone with an iphone 8 and below. Newer phones are very similar but I will still say the iphone 11 pro is a better phone.",5,10/11/19 23:33
10,Great Phone that scratches easily,"I love the phone, especially the camera. After upgrading from a 7 Plus, I got used to the new gestures and lack of home button very quickly. The only negative I have is that, after having several iPhones and never using a screen protector, after less than 2 weeks, my screen has a scratch deep enough for me to feel with my fingernail. I have no idea how it happened because I've treated it the same as all other non-scratched phones. It's bothering me to see so I guess I'll have to put a screen protector on it. Maybe it'll hide the scratch. There is a discussion about it on the Apple page as well. I recommend the phone, just go ahead and put a screen protector on it from the start.",5,10/25/19 21:44
11,Awesome phone.,"It’s been seven days with it and can say that it is a great iPhone 
I come from an iPhone XR that i had for barely 4months, it’s crazy!
Prior to that i had an iPhone 6 for 5 years and an iPhone 4s for 4 years, so am not exactly a compulsive iPhone buyer hehe, The only reason that I switch my XR for the 11 Pro was the camera AND because i had the chance to get a good deal on it, but the iOS its great too. i was one of the lucky ones that didn’t get pesky bugs with it. I don’t know how to really describe it all i can tell that so far this is an awesome phone. The pictures it takes look professional, videos and games vey crisp, of course everything else is good too, calls, Bluetooth connectivity with my devices is great no drops, Siri is more intelligent now.so much that am actually using it. Am just a happy iPhone owner the kind of happiness that only iPhone owners know, if you have a chance to upgrade don’t hesitate, you wont regret it.",5,9/27/19 18:08
12,Great for people who love taking photos!,"I know this is said every year but this is truly the best iPhone camera Apple has ever made! In addition to that, the battery is incredible. I can go a whole day without needing to worry about charging it. If you’re fan of gaming on the go, the new selection of games on Apple Arcade look absolutely beautiful on this giant screen. With the new processor, some of these games can almost stand up with console games in terms of graphics and quality. And lastly, the phone itself is absolutely beautiful to look at and hold. The three cameras took some getting used to at first but now they look great imo.",5,10/19/19 11:55
13,Amazing camera!,"Decided to upgrade from iPhone X. Amazing quality only Apple provides. Longer battery life, unbelievably fast, and pictures are amazing! Previous iPhone cameras were not good in low light or in settings with bright sun in background. Pro max delivers amazing photos and videos in all lighting. Wife initially upgraded to the Note10+, but changed to a Pro Max for the overall functionality and camera.",5,10/5/19 03:37
14,The bomb battery  liiiife,"I’m enjoying my upgrade I had the XS and I must say the battery life on this phone is the best one to date! The new square and battery upgrade was needed! I enjoy the cameras yes they’re lovely being that I’m a selfie gal but the battery is where it’s at period for me!!! I left it off the charger for a entire day and tada my phone didn’t die out! I’m a heavy user but during this time I kept it basic normal lighting, texting was over the top and I’d say social media 6 hours  off and on. My battery went down to 10%. I’m impressed!",5,10/18/19 16:12
15,Best ever!!!,"I have been hard using Apple devices for the last 12 years, and I own almost all top devices under Apple brand and I have to say you that I have a big problem....

All my devices bought on the last 10 years are still working and I can’t imagine bring them to recycling, so I believe that I’m a few years I will have a persona museum to show to the new generations of my relatives part of the tech history!!!

Everything always can be better, and I’m sure that Apple devices are on the way to become day by day a little better ever!!!",5,10/18/19 20:09
16,If you’re military never deal with Best Buy,If you’re looking for a military discount for your account do not go through Best Buy. They don’t have any idea of what the bill should actually be and don’t work for the carriers directly and will have absolutely zero answers when there is an issue. the phone is great but don’t do it....,5,12/27/19 15:29
17,Excellent,"My iPhone XSMax is one of my favorite and best phones. I think I have had every model of the iPhone except the 8.  The iPh 11 ProMax improves on the older model quite a lot. They look identical except for the camera, but it really is a big improvement in battery life, screen, picture quality and function. Quality feel and look is excellent.   I do hope it is not plagued with battery issues as so many modern day iPhones tend to have.   Its expensive !",5,10/2/19 00:46
18,Great!,As always the iPhone 11 Pro Max is easy to use. Camera is great too! I am happy to say that Apple didn't disappoint with the new upgrades.,5,2/5/20 13:59
19,It’s a nice size. Good product,Very intuitive just like the other Apple productsGood product. It’s easy to see easy to read I have a small hand it’s not too big or too or falling out of my hand I do have a silicone case so in case it does fall it won’t break. It is a little of a chore getting used to it because it doesn’t have the home button like my seven did but I’m sure that will just come a time,5,10/17/19 16:46
20,Too much phone for a 17 year old,"I bought this for my daughters birthday. She is 17 and the Iphone 11 probably would have been good enough. It is huge but a very nice phone. She bought the silver one and the color is almost white in color. It is a great phone, just like the last one",5,10/5/19 08:37
21,IPhone 11 Pro Max,"Everything from the display, to the size of the screen, the design of the phone is absolutely great! I would highly recommend this phone to any and everyone . If you dont mind spending the extra money definitely purchase this phone.",5,12/14/19 20:27
22,Great phone,"Needed a upgrade from my 8 plus ! So far so good great phone. Still getting used to different features. 
Can’t complain! Definitely like the bigger screen!",5,1/18/20 11:23
23,Awesome!!,I had the original iPhone And then was strictly Samsung....I traded in my galaxy 10 plus for the 11 Pro max and don’t regret it in the slightest... this phone is a beast,5,1/10/20 15:23
24,All around great except reception,"I’ve been part of the Apple Ecosystem for going on 10 years now and the iPhone 11 series is by far the best offering yet. Camera is a huge upgrade, which I didn’t think was possible, and the battery seems to last forever. Plus it’s super fast and the screen looks great. Only issue I’m having is slightly less reception than I did on my Xs Max.",5,10/19/19 05:24
25,Great phone... not much difference from XS Max,I upgraded from the XS Max to the 11 Pro Max because I’m on the iPhone forever plan so I figured as the phone will depreciate faster than the value will hold... and because I could upgrade for a minimal upgrade fee I might as well get the latest and greatest. Works great. Camera and battery are noticeably better although!,5,10/23/19 22:46
26,Phone is amazing!,This iPhone is by far the best one I’ve had yet! I absolutely love the picture and sound quality. The pictures this phone takes is absolutely amazing and makes me feel like a wannabe photographer. My one massive flaw I have with this phone is that it’s on the sprint network. Everything else on this phone is perfect except for the carrier.,5,10/11/19 15:52
27,iPhone 11 Pro Max is the Gold Standard,"I upgraded to this model from an iPhone X.  Both are great cell phones and I really cannot find many useful differences in the phone function.  The camera on the 11 Pro Max is an upgrade that I have not had the phone long enough to explore, but so far the pictures are excellent.",5,11/4/19 15:54
28,Impressive,"This is a snappy phone- coming from Android has been interesting, but it looks promising with its speed and overall smoothness. I have had the occasional crash however. I hope those are few and far between.",5,12/7/19 21:31
29,About time they up the camera game,I had the iPhone 7plus since it came out waited a long time for a decent upgrade very happy with the phone I would recommend it highly,5,9/29/19 16:00
30,Enjoy the bigger phone,"I upgraded to the iPhone 11 Pro Max from an iPhone X .  I enjoy the bigger screen, but it is a little uncomfortable when it is in my pocket.  Other than that, I love the phone and am glad we upgraded when we did.",5,12/4/19 09:29
31,Great phone,I went from having a iPhone 8 to this phone and I love it! I thought that I was going to have some difficulty with not having the home button but I am now used to it,5,12/27/19 16:18
32,iPhone 11 pro max nice little phone,I very much like the 11 pro max over the ax’s max which was not a very friendly iPhone for me. So far the 11 pro Max has met expectations even though it has only been in my possession a couple of weeks. I expect to probably keep this model for a couple of years until the 5G models arrive in a couple of years.,5,10/11/19 16:17
33,Amazing camera and battery,"This phone wasn’t a huge upgrade from my X but I’m glad I did it the battery is the longest I’ve had in a phone as far as I can tell, and the camera quality is amazing as always, it’s a little heavier probably because it’s sturdier I would definitely recommend it",5,11/3/19 11:37
34,iPhone 11 Pro Max awesome upgrade,I love the ease of online ordering my new iPhone 11 pro max silver avoiding lines at the store. Quick pickup once I reached the store. Apple products always packaged well and bestbuy threw in a new SIM card.,5,9/25/19 16:50
35,"Love the phone, hate the hassle of setting up","This is the first phone that I have had to set up myself, rather than a technician do it. It took 4+ hours to get it working between  figuring out the SIMS card and how to open the compartment (had to use a youtube video) and getting it activated on Sprint (3 calls and nearly 3 and 1/2 hours). The phone now works great and looks amazing.",5,9/23/19 12:00
36,iPhone Green,I really like the new iPhone. I recently got the new iPhone in Green and the color is really cool and different. I like the new camera feature that seems to take better pictures than my old 7plus. So I would go with the new iPhone in Green if I had to make the choice all over again.,5,10/19/19 07:50
37,IPhone 11 Pro Max,"I loved my IPhone 7 Plus. So when deciding on a new phone, it was a easy choice going with the IPhone 11 Pro Max! Still getting use to some new features but so far, so good!",5,12/13/19 16:31
38,Great Phone,Upgraded from an iPhone 6 (since no more iOS updates).  The difference is obviously huge. This phone should last me another 5 to 6 generations since Sprint will take forever on 5G rollout.,5,9/27/19 15:20
39,Amazing camera and features,Previously had iPhone X so this was an upgrade...overall great phone,5,1/31/20 15:11

43,Iphone 11 Pro Max,I upgraded with Sprint and I love it. I also got the iphone 11 for free with a new activation,5,1/19/20 20:15
44,"Great Camera, Great Phone","The iPhone 11 Pro Max is an amazing phone. It has a great battery life, awesome cameras, and an outstanding display. Although, if you already own a X (pronounced Ten) or a XS/XS Max, I wouldn’t recommend upgrading yet unless it’s in your contract to do so.",5,10/19/19 09:12
45,Great Phone,"Had to get this for the wife, since I was upgrading mine. She went from an iPhone 8 so not as big a leap as my iPhone 6 upgrade. Wife still likes this more than her old phone.",5,9/27/19 15:25

53,Loving this phone,"I waited a while to do the review because I usually change my mind after a few months, but I’m still in love with this phone. I updgraded from an iPhone X & it’s definitely a difference in the picture quality.",4,1/18/20 15:06
54,Very nice,What can I say it’s an IPhone it works my last IPhone was a 7 plus 3 yrs old still works great gave it to my son hopefully this one last as long read up on the features it does exactly what it’s supposed to do what I can say though the battery life is WOW amazing,5,10/4/19 15:27

61,iphone = excellent,"felt like upgrading, wasn't sure if i wanted the pro max but i figured, ehh, just get it!  so i did!",5,1/2/20 09:27
62,Unimpressed,"I have had this phone just over a month. Many many functions but not sure if necessary. I am not a big fan of the new touch style screen. Takes time to get used to it and allows usage problems depending on the individuals touch. Screens lock up during texting , email and while sending photos. I had to shut it down numerous times to free up the frozen screen. Camera is quite complicated and tricky to use. I think I liked my IPhone 8 Plus better but time will tell.",3,1/31/20 22:09

67,Best iPhone ever,This phone has some awesome upgrades. The camera is phenomenal. Speed is unbeatable. Picture clarity is awesome. I’ve gone over a day in a half without charging the phone. Not just a normal day but on a four hour car trip on it constantly. Kudos to Apple.,5,9/27/19 15:25
68,"Best iPhone yet, 11 Pro Max",I held off for two years and was skeptical to purchase the new phone. I think it was a great decision to buy now. It is much faster and the iOS update works well. Best part is the picture quality which matched my SLR.,5,10/18/19 17:43

82,1st Time iPhone user,"I really like the phone. When I saw it I was thinking maybe I'll get one. The only thing I don't like is with android you were able to create groups for texting and emailing, etc. I have not been able to do that with this phone and was told it couldn't be done on IOS. There are some improvements I would like to see Apple make but overall it's a great phone.",4,10/26/19 11:54

85,Just what I needed,"Wanted a bigger phone so I decided to upgrade from my iPhone X.  Wanted the phone on launch day, but the best buy near my house was sold out even though the website indicated they had stock. So I decided to check the website the next day and they had 1 in stock about 30 miles away, so I took my chances and ordered online for 1 hour pick up.  Phone was ready in about 2 hours, but pick up and setting up Iphone was a breeze.",4,9/27/19 15:36

It is very expensive yes, and it does what most other iPhones can do but this phone does it all so quick and smoothly. Every app loads up quick, and the battery life is outstanding. I take my phone off the charger at about 1pm and head out at 3pm. By the time I get home at around 1am I still have 50 to 60% battery life left. I use my phone quite a bit throughout the day to play Pokémon go lol and watch YouTube / browse the web and social media. 
The camera is also remarkable, especially when shooting video. It takes the best video I’ve seen on a smartphone, I always shoot at 4K 60fps and it’s crisp and pretty. Especially in low light / concerts. The screen on this iPhone is very bright and colors pop nicely. It’s my favorite smartphone ever. I know this phone is very expensive, but If you’re a “power user” and want a great camera on your phone, then I think it’s worth the money. Skip the base model and get at least 256gb though. You’ll quickly eat up storage if you take a lot of video.",5,11/26/19 22:35
284,Not much different,I bought phone and honestly not much different than X max pro  I actually enjoyed that phone more some features were removed on the new model ie the 3D Touch,3,11/8/19 16:13
285,Great camera!,Camera takes very good quality photos. The panoramic feature is great. The battery life is the best I’ve experienced thus far and the Face ID feature is almost instant.,5,12/6/19 19:48
286,just ok,very heavy foe a phone ....................................,3,12/20/19 20:10
287,No need to upgrade,"This phone is no different from iPhone XS Max other than the camera and the back design. It’s basically the same phone,The only thing good is the charger",2,1/24/20 17:33
288,Camera great,The freezes up often. Have to keep resetting the phone or deleting app. And then downloading again.,3,10/18/19 17:11
289,Crapy Camera,The camera is not what it should be for the amount uou pay for the phone.,3,10/25/19 15:41
290,Phone is great but not sprint,When i took the phone they said i need to pay 25 dollars/mon. But later when i saw my bill its  alot greater than i expected. When i reached the customer service agents every individual is giving me different opinions. One said they can reduce the bill and one say it is the least price. I am really confused by the sprint,1,11/8/19 15:42
291,Do not buy!,There is nothing exciting about this device. There was nothing much changed since iPhone 8 plus. Do not buy the product so apple gets the message that they need to do a better job. Just like it was during Steve Jobs. Epic fail!,1,9/28/19 18:06
292,No purchase,"My keys were stolen, your keytag was attached. Whoever purchased this phone was a thief",2,10/11/19 15:43

297,Beautiful pictures,Camera takes beautiful pictures. Very easy to use. Thanks,5,11/23/19 17:31
298,I don’t think it’s quite worth it’s cost.,"I don’t think it’s quite worth it’s cost.  It freezes up from time to time. Picture quality is great, however sometimes it won’t save the image it took or will capture a blurry one when camera was still during shot. 
Everything else is good, but same as a regular IPhone.",3,1/19/20 18:35
299,Excellent,"Was a little hesitant about spending the extra money on the current version thinking I wasn't going to need the new features. Glad I did. The new camera is phenomenal. So glad I changed my mind. Worth it just for the camera. Still think it's a little too expensive but hey, it's Apple. It's either pay what they want or shop another company.",5,12/1/19 09:49
300,The camera is awesome. I LOVE it!,"After I upgraded to this phone, four members of my family upgraded too. We all love the camera features and the size of the phone. Still learning about more functions it has. Having fun with it.",5,1/3/20 17:00
301,Upgrade if you can,This is definitely a difference between the 10 and the 7. The camera features on this phone is worth the upgrade. It’s like having a GoPro with phone capabilities. If you enjoy taking pictures with your phone this is the one to upgrade to. Apple jumped on fixing the small bugs that the original software had and the phone works great.,5,10/27/19 19:46
302,Great IPhone,Went from an IPhone 6s to the 11 Pro Max 265gb- big jump.  The battery does last all day and the camera is the best I have ever had.  No complaints yet other than the price tag,5,12/27/19 18:20

307,Good camera,"Phone has major glitches, but I’m sure apple will correct them over time. The quality of the phone and features are amazing. I don’t like the camera placement on the back, but I got over it quickly because it’s not like I’m looking at it all the time.",5,10/11/19 18:13
308,11 Pro Max,This phone is amazing. The camera is awesome. It holds a long charge and is amazing.,5,1/10/20 22:27
309,Great Phone,"The Midnight Green in pictures look great, but in person, the color is not much different than the Space Grey. The phone is great though, this was for my gf who upgraded from the 7+ so she is really enjoying the new features. I would suggest that if you have an X or Xs then there is no real point in upgrading other than the new camera feature and specs that the normal users will never know the difference with the naked eye.",4,10/18/19 16:32
310,New Phone - Go Apple 11 pro!,The new Apple 11pro max is a very good phone.  Upgraded from Apple 7.  Great features that make Apple phones super easy to use.  The camera smokes all other camera phones on the market.  Android users have made this comment to me.,5,10/11/19 17:50

360,Overall a great phone,Its hard to be revolutionary every year but it shouldn’t take away from the solid build of the phone. It may not be worth the upgrade if you have the iPhone X or newer but certainly worth it for any older phones.

428,Solid Update & Great Performing Camera,"Having owned my old iPhone 7 Plus for 3 years but still running great, I hadn’t thought much about buying another phone until the 11 Pro was announced. I liked what Apple offered on it and made the investment. I wasn’t disappointed and even surprised in other features like the fact it can use AT&Ts 5GE network which isn’t real 5G but LTE using multiple antennas to double up the bandwidth. Cool! As for the camera and battery, the reason I bought it, didn’t disappoint me. Taking pics is now a lot more powerful and faster yet keeps it simple and battery life helps enjoy it for longer as it’s the best I’ve ever had on any smartphone. I’ve been averaging about 15 hours of heavy usage in the last couple of days. Everything from enjoying music and videos, texting, phones calls, IG & Snapchat. Even did some video editing after capturing some video and taking pictures. I’m sure I can improve the life once the novelty of it goes away and I don’t turn it on unnecessarily. LoL As always its way faster and the screen looks amazing in any light. Though a little heavier than any phone I’ve used, the Midnight Green looks awesome in my opinion. As to why I like using an iPhone, I know there are lots of choices running Android but the simplicity of taking pics and video, editing them and syncing them across my devices and posting them while on the move are key for me. So, that’s my take on the iPhone 11 Pro Max after the last 4 days.",5,9/23/19 21:15
429,Pretty impressive!,"I waited to upgrade my 8 plus even though i could have done so when the 11 was out. Watched alot of reviews  and finally upgraded about 2 weeks ago and oh boy iam impressed with the improvement on the camera department!although its not like day and night different! I could care less about other features tbh, to me the best camera is the one that you always have in your pocket. Thats why i upgraded and it was because i was due to upgrade. If i wasnt id rather wait untill my 8 plus paid off and skip this gen of iphone and wait for the 12 or something. The camera is worth the upgrade from my 8 plus but still i dont think it deserves the ridiculous 1250 dollar price tag. If you have the 8 plus or the x series and they are not paid off yet, trust me you can wait but if you want to be that guy/girl who always wants to have the latest and the greatest from apple and have tons of money to burn, well no one can stop you doesnt matter how many honest reviews you have read or watch.",5,10/31/19 18:32
430,Love it,I wasn’t gonna upgrade from the X but the screen broke and to fix it it was gonna cost $300 which is more than what I needed to pay to upgrade so I did it lol. The camera is awesome and the battery life is great. Fast charging is a complete game changing too. I know people will say Samsung is better but for me with everything I own is Apple this phone is perfect for me and I like the iOS VS android so IMO if you’re looking for a new phone with a great camera get this one.,5,10/18/19 18:23
431,Wow! Just wow!,"Ok, so I went from the X to this phone and was not sure if I’d see a real difference. But you can tell! I got the Max and while it does feel slightly larger it is not bad at all. My two big things I love is the camera at night and the battery life. 

I did multiple side by side pictures at night using the wife’s iPhone X and the 11. Noticeable difference. Some of the night pictures come out a little yellowish but it is still better than getting nothing like I was before. The two pictures below were in different lighting environments and they both came out great. The one of the vehicles was taken at about 4am with no lights on whatsoever. 

Battery life is great and lasts all day. Need I say more?!",5,10/17/19 16:39
432,What a camera!,I’ve never seen night photos on a cellphone like this one. Completely unreal. Also the brightness and resolution of the screen is mesmerizing.,5,9/27/19 16:26
433,amazing camera and improved sound quality,The sound quality is far improved and I am still learning all the capabilities of the camera. It is far more durable than it looks. Nice job Apple!,5,10/5/19 07:47
434,Very happy.,This phone does everything. Best cameras and best everything.,5,10/25/19 18:26
435,Love it.,Best iPhone ever! Elegant and functionally great. Resolution superb and battery life significant better. Ios13 makes puts me into the star week zone.,5,9/27/19 15:17
436,Love the new camera!,"I just purchased the new iPhone 11 Pro Max a week ago, I have just scratched the surface of learning everything this iPhone is capable of....but I love it already! The camera is phenomenal, I love the design and the 6.8” screen size.",5,9/28/19 08:16
437,I always been a apple head but i just love ever,"This phone is beautiful, i have 2 max pros and 1 XSMax it’s a big upgrade for me even if nothing changed. Lol but seriously it’s a cool phone.",5,9/27/19 15:44
438,I went max and it is beautiful,"Received mine yesterday and after been using apple products for over 10 years, I must say this one is the best so far. The correct size, the cameras are superb and feels good in the hand. Waiting for xmas to get the apple watch 5.",5,9/24/19 05:33
439,LOVE IT SO FAR,Upgraded from an xs max and I’m in love with it so far !,5,9/21/19 10:29
440,iPhone 11 Pro Max Extreme lens flare issues,"I'm having extreme lens flare issues and any little light situation, I can't get this resolved. I've tried Apple, they replace my phone with refurbished one, then they replace my lenses but still I'm experiencing the following;

441,11pro max,"Love the bigger screen. The camera is great, still learning. 
The battery is much improved.",5,12/27/19 19:26
442,Amazing Device!!,First thing: the camera is Amazing! Specially in portrait mode creates a beautiful shallow background isolating the subject nicely and actually looks natural! Screen resolution is incredible for watching movies that have night scenes the darks and shadows are rich with lots of contrast ! I upgraded from the 6s plus that was also an amazing phone but the 11 pro blew me away!,5,11/24/19 09:11
443,Best IPhone Yet,Remarkable features and sleek design with a powerful clear camera. The balance and weight of the device is fundamentally sound. Truly the fastest processor on any iPhone to date. Worth the buy/upgrade.,5,12/14/19 12:30
444,Amazing Camera & Battery,"So, at this point if you are not familiar with iOS and what iPhones are all about here comes a short summary. Apple iPhones are normally great hardware, build quality, and easy UI. Unlike Android, normally you don’t hear spec sheets on iPhone. RAM, battery size, processors are usually a mute point because they iPhone run iOS which can’t really compared to Android. Don’t get me wrong I’ve used many, many Android phones (most recently the Samsung Note 10+) and they have some amazing phones, with equally amazing cameras, and features. 

So, what sets this iPhone apart from the ones that have come before, even the XS, is the cameras are a huge step forward, and they battery is hard to kill. Most phones take great photos in optimal lighting conditions. What sets phones apart is how they handle low light, or night photography. Here is where this iPhone really shines. The images that this device is able to capture with little light is amazing. With Deep Fusion around the corner, you will also see an increase in detail in most photos that don’t use the Night shot mode or HDR. The battery holds up amazingly well. Even after a day of heavy usage, screen on over 8 hours I am able to end the day around 20-30% easily. I usually unplug around 6am and plug it back in around 10-11pm. Never do I feel like I need to top off the battery for fear of not making it through the day.

Everything else on the phone is still great, but not what I would consider a huge step up from previous models. Screen looks amazing, super bright in direct sunlight, Speakers are great, sometimes I forgo my Bluetooth speaker and just use the phones speakers. The matte glass back feels great, but most people won’t see it since most cover it up with a case to protect this investment. 

I would definitely recommend this to anyone, especially those already locked in to the Apple ecosystem. Apple’s iOS 13 is great, and offers some great features, but that isn’t specific to this phone so go and upgrade your old device first to see what you are getting here. I am very happy with my upgrade.",5,10/20/19 14:20
445,Cost to value ratio is closing,"I really like this iphone and iOS in general. However, what is up with iphone charging $1100 for 64gb vs Samsung Note 10+ offering 256gb in addition to an SD card option for the same price? Things like this are making me take pause about my decision to stay in the Apple ecosystem. I've had this phone a week and I still can't confirm in my mind if this makes sense, to keep my iphone simply because I want everything to work between my apple watch and my ipad. To make me question things even harder, i can get the Note 10+ with 256gb for $150 less than this iphone. Are the camera's that great that it's worth this price bump? These are the things that keep me up at night until my return period expires then I'm in for the next year at least. Never the less, this phone is pretty great so I'm rating it accordingly. No idea if I'm going to keep it or not yet, though.",4,9/27/19 15:52
446,THE BATTERY! OH MY! THE CAMERA!,"Okay, I'm hearing impaired. I heavily rely on video communication versus voice communication. So I easily drain my battery on my iPhone. But after upgrading to this, you have no idea how thrilled I am to have an iPhone that lasts me from the time I wake up until the time I go to sleep. The battery hasn't gotten low when going to bed. It's so great! When upgrading from iPhone X to iPhone XS Max, I was horrified by the front camera's beautify feature. I take a lot of selfies on X until XS Max, I never took selfie ever again. It was awful not seeing my face naturally because it looks like I'm wearing makeup or own a Samsung phone. However, upgrading to iPhone 11 Pro Max... I was so happy to see that the selfie camera is back to natural like photos. No, beautify garbage.",5,1/14/20 04:17
447,Great phone!,"This is my phone, and it offers significant advantages over our old 6s’s. First, facial recognition has been flawless not only for the phone, but for apps that accept it. It also is much easier to unlock and use (just look at the face of the phone) than finger print recognition. We also like the fact that we can get a charging pad for it, rather than having to plug and unplug a charging wire. The Apple wires are too short, and the longer 3rd-party ones do not hold up, in my experience, with constant use. The wide, normal, and telephoto lenses are a big improvement. The camera also is far more complex and versatile than the one I had on my 6s. I recommend going online for instructional info. The only thing I am still getting accustomed to is not taking screen-shots (pressing volume up button and on/off button simultaneously). I like the space gray.",5,12/31/19 13:56
448,Amazing!!!!!,"So I was content with my iPhone X for years and didn’t see much reason for an upgrade. After seeing what the iPhone 11 Pro Max had to offer I made not only a leap into a newer phone but also my first oversized phone. I love it!
the sound when watching Movies is very immersive completely blew me away for a smartphone!
I have yet to get into all the extra’s but what I have done in the new camera app running the new Tri Cam set up has been nothing short of amazing! Brilliant colors excellent clarity even the less talked about focused audio recording works great when filming your kids riding off on bikes just a little zoom and the sound and image is as if they never left your side. 
Battery life is impressive I forgot to charge over night and managed to make it through the next day of work. 
I have had nothing but fun enjoying my new iPhone Pro Max if you are considering making the switch I say go for it!!!


Ps my only complaint @apple I miss 3D Touch but I have got along without it as well it’s just so hard to say goodbye to yes......3D touch.",5,9/29/19 22:08
449,Stellar phone,"It really is a great phone! Best one yet.
Extremely durable, battery life is AMAZING, and 
Here are some things that I’ve noticed that aren’t necessarily bad, but might bother others:
- while the triple lenses are nice, picture quality still sucks. I will say that wide angle lens is awesome tho.
- night mode in the camera settings cannot stay permanently off. It’s great for light absorption in dark situations (similar to a long shutter speed on a dslr), but waiting 1-3 seconds for the picture to process is quite annoying. Especially when you either wanted a dark picture, or have subjects that can’t sit still. You can tap the night mode icon and slide the timer to off, but this must be done every time it detects inadequate light. 
- it’s heavy! Maybe because I came from the 8 & X, but still, for a phone, it’s quite the dense rock lol.
- the screen is “tall”; the Max models are larger In general, but compared to previous Plus models that had top & bottom caption-style hardware/home buttons, this one is pretty long compared to its lack of wideness. If you one-hand operate a lot, I’d recommend playing in many different apps to get a feel for how far you’ll have to stretch lol.
- the flashlight gives a pinkish hue.. unimportant I’m sure, but it’s also not as bright. 
Overall a great device and I would absolutely purchase again!",5,11/1/19 16:19
450,This is a great phone!,I’ve been waiting to see whether I wanted to purchase the 11 pro max or wait for the new 12 to come out. I got the 11 pro max and I don’t regret it. It’s better than the iPhone X that I had because I missed the big screen and the ease of a bigger phone in my hands. I love the midnight green color as well. It’s much more different than the basic colors that have been available in the past. The cameras are ASTOUNDING!!!!!!! This gives me a new reason to take more pictures of myself and my wife when we are out and about.,5,1/31/20 19:35
451,Apple Is For Winners,"“If you’re not first, you’re last” I wanted the best, I wanted to be a winner, so I bought an Apple iPhone. Siri has helped take me to where I am right now. I’m not going to tell you my exact location because then you’ll prolly wanna come and take selfies with MY amazingly awesome iPhone 11pro. Because it takes great selfies and while I consider myself rather dashing at times (I clean up well) I never really considered myself THAT photogenic. That is until this new iPhone. I almost wanna jump out there and call myself an instagram model? Dare to dream? Yes! I know. This phone is THAT awesome!",5,1/4/20 08:58
452,Just a flawless product again,"I got this phone to replace a flawless 2 year old iPhone X, mainly for the larger screen. You can never go wrong with an iPhone. It’s just a very well executed device that will always work. It might not have all the latest features, but at least the features and processes are perfected. I’m really happy with this phone and the screen size is just right; it’s much easier to type on. The speakers are loud, the battery and cameras are amazing, and most importantly it just works.",5,9/22/19 07:30
453,Superb!,"Just Upgraded to this from my iPhone 8 Plus 256gb. I see no difference from the XSmax, but the camera is awesome! I can take great selfies with portrait mode and the wide angle is awesome as well. The main reason I upgraded, really. This gives me an alternative for when I need to leave my Nikon D5600 in the room since it is bulky. Face ID is great. I feel like this phone is easier for me to hold without it slipping. My only issues is that I have to bring the control center down to see the battery percentage and the part that contains the face camera takes up a small portion of the screen. Nothing major.",5,10/4/19 17:26
454,Pro max 11,Awesome phone love the 3 camera pics well it's my son's phone so he loved it even more.. Thanks,2,1/3/20 15:54
455,Best Phone Ever!,"There’s not really a whole lot you have to say to convince someone that the iPhone 11 Pro Max is the worlds best cellular phone. There’s not really anything bad that I can say about it. The only negative to an $1,100 phone is that it doesn’t come with AirPods and it doesn’t have a USB-C charging port. I bought a wireless charging stand for at home and at work, so it doesn’t really matter a whole lot, but it would have been nice to have a only one charging port for all of my devices (iPhone, iPad, MacBook Pro, etc.)",5,12/22/19 18:38
456,"So Far, Love this phone","First Apple product so it will take some getting used to, but I like the features I see. Facial scanning is a first for me. It really works to unlock your phone. The color (green) is unique and nice. I also got the 256GB storage I wanted by getting it at Best Buy. That one is always sold out everywhere else. Yet to use the camera but looking forward to it.",5,1/24/20 15:16
457,"Brilliant camera, lighting fast, and long battery!","You could not ask for a better combination. Downside Apple released the phone with the new IOS that contained a number of bugs.  To be fair they have already started releasing updates to fix those, but still expected a little more from Apple on a new IOS and phone release.
I got the Pro, while a family member also purchased the regular iPhone.  Both great phones, and really the biggest noticeable difference is the camera, which comes in handy for my job. Zooming in for photos or videos still provides crystal clear images.  I had a chance to the difference in pictures when we recently attended a concert.  With all the lighting effects, the iPhone 11 to good photos, but the Pro, lets just say that I was asked to send all my photos to my family member!",5,10/26/19 09:54
458,Very happy,"This was a must for my daughter,  she gets the newest phone every time  the phone is available for an upgraded as a Christmas gift.  Witch is every other year.  No headaches, no returns during the holidays, it’s a wonderful thing as well as the 11 PRO MAX is I think the best version so far.    I did this with all three kids and my youngest is 19 so you can imagine how many phones I’ve used and purchased.",5,1/10/20 18:40
459,Top of the line phone won't disappoint,"Purchased to have better camera. Camera is awesome and will be using it for video recording.

The face recognition is awesome. The finger scan unlock in the previous version I had didn't work when my fingers were wet. Amazing to not have to do anything but look at it.

The battery has been spectacular.",5,2/3/20 07:06
460,Apple did it again,"I love this phone, I’ve been iPhone user for years and years but the reason I gave 4 star is because the front camera sucks. iPhone 6,7 and 8 had better camera than 11pro and pro max. Overall phone is awesome.",4,10/11/19 15:20
461,Great phone!,"Take everything you thought was good about the last iPhone and make it a little bit better. That’s about it. Well actually, the camera Is quite a bit better!  Other than that, it’s just better all around n every measurable way. Should you buy this if you are currently using a 10s??  Depends on how important the camera is to you. Put it this way- if your on aTT next or whatever program your carrier offers, and your due for an upgrade, YES get it. If you have a xs and it’s paid off, I would say hold on. But if your paying 40 some odd dollars for the Xs every month and you Are due for an upgrade, might as well get the new one.  That’s just my opinion.",5,10/18/19 19:16
462,The best iPhone so far,"I have owned every iPhone release since iPhone 3GS, except for the iPhone 7 and 8 and the iPhone 11 Pro Max has every feature you would want from an iPhone from better battery life to amazing cameras. I upgraded from a iPhone 10s Max and even though the diferrences might seem small they are bigger than what it seems, that is not to say that the iPhone 10s Max was lagging in performance, it was still a good device. Each year Apple releases the best iPhone from thir previous iteration. If you want any of the missing features such as bilateral wireless charging, USB C, different design, then wait for the new iPhone in 2020 or go buy the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+, but if you love using iPhones then this is the one to get.",5,9/28/19 08:45
463,So far it's a nice phone,"I still had an iPhone 7s so it was time for an upgrade. I miss the home button but I'm slowly getting used to the ""swipe up"" feature. And the face recognition is nice. 
I don't do a lot with my phone so I haven't played with all the bells and whistles but it takes great pictures. 
Battery life is decent but not as great as I thought it should be.",5,1/2/20 08:31
464,Great clarity and impressive speeds,"I’ve always had great luck with iPhones. Love the features and design. However, I have had broken screens on the X and now a clear scratch on this new 11 pro max. For the screens to supposedly be so great, I haven’t had much luck.",5,1/31/20 15:12
465,Big Improvement,"Bought this as an upgrade from my iPhone 7 Plus. It was working OK but was out of on board storage. After owning it for less that two weeks I can say that the 11 Pro Max is better in every way. Screen colors, performance, camera, everything. Even the speakerphone is better. The cost was tough to swallow, but I'm very happy with the purchase so far.",5,12/20/19 20:20
466,A Great update,"While some might think the 3 camera setup is not the best design, the new phone is a great improvement.  I love the third lens and the setup.  I don't feel like I'm always getting my fingers in the way and I can see so much more in my photos.  Besides that the screen in the pro series is phenominal and an understated point …. I can easily see everything on the new display even in direct sunlight.  With the X and XS series I used to have to wonder because it wold be darker but this guy can keep up....  Besides all that I am loving the battery saving features of this phone it really is a large improvement with the A13 processor!",5,9/28/19 06:08
467,Great Phone,"I've switched between iPhone and Android often.  I'm really enjoying the 11 Pro Max.  For me personally, I like that it's heavier than past models and a little thicker.  The battery life has been great along with the cameras.    

If you have the X, XR, or XS it's not worth upgrading if you don't use the camera that often.  All of the improvements are great, but not worth upgrading just yet, in my opinion.",5,9/23/19 16:50
468,Best Buy experience excellent!,"We were focused on this phone, and based on previous experiences, decided Best Buy was our best plan. They had what we were looking for in inventory (could see on the website before going), and as always, were met and helped quickly and positively upon arrival. Great experience!",5,1/10/20 16:22
469,A Much Needed Upgrade,"My iPhone X was getting a little slow and glitchy. The 11 Pro is an amazing phone. I love the new frosted look and the new camera system is unbeatable. If you have the XS I would probably wait for the 2020 iPhone, but other than that I'd recommend the upgrade.",5,10/5/19 10:36
470,Greatest iPhone Yet!,"Most reviews I’ve read about the iPhone 11 Pro seem to lean towards it being nearly the same as the iPhone X. While the front may look the same, I’m here to tell you the internal components are where Apple invested their money on this newest version. The new A13 chip is incredibly snappy, the camera’s picture quality in low light settings is the best it’s ever been, and the battery life is outstanding. Yes, this wasn’t a dramatic visual overhaul of the iPhone, but Apple made significant improvements to the internal components and I am an extremely satisfied customer.",5,9/27/19 19:31
471,Best yet!,"The best iPhone yet! Has an awesome screen with the super retina XDR OLED display. It makes pictures and videos look amazing. The back glass is beautiful, it has the frosted glass look to it. Cameras are amazing and take the best pictures on any smartphone. Love the ultra wide camera. Very fast when performing tasks. With iOS you get updates very quickly and security is the best out there. Face ID is awesome and even faster now. This phone is amazing.",5,10/29/19 13:06
472,GREAT iPhone,Glad I waited to get this model 11 Pro Max 256 GB so well worth the wait.. LOVING the 3 cameras!!! Love  the photos it takes plus it's a GREAT phone ... Plenty of storage space with the 256 GB easy to use and at last Apple improved battery life thank you Apple. Can go several days without a charge. Newest version of software works great NO issues. Had a iPhone 7 Plus LOVED that iPhone too.... it's for sale on eBay by the way.,5,11/1/19 15:44
473,Unsurpassed elegance & superb performance,"It is like holding a small high powered computer in the palm of your hand. Everything about the iPhone 11 Pro Max is perfect, except the price! The best feature I loved is the new 12MP triple camera system that allows you to take high quality ultra wide photos with ease. Bought this phone for my wife as a replacement for iPhone 8 Plus, and even though the 8 plus is slightly bigger than iPhone 11 Pro Max, the screen is about an inch larger in iPhone 11 Pro than 8 Plus. My wife absolutely loves it.",5,10/4/19 18:41
474,iPhone lover.,I upgraded from the XS Max. It was well worth the upgrade for the amazing camera and battery life!  The camera is fantastic. It makes it so quick and easy to adjust for close up and wide angle pictures. The clarity is something else. I can go 2 days with one battery charge and I’ve never been able to do that in the past with a iPhone. Don’t hesitate to upgrade!,5,11/9/19 01:07
475,Upgraded from a iPhone X,"I tried the Note 10+ and I REALLY wanted to like that phone but ultimately I ended up returning it and waiting for the iPhone 11 Pro Max.  I just wanted a bigger phone and the iPhone just ticked all the boxes.  I'm not as invested in the Apple infrastructure as I once was but I still chose the iPhone over the Note for fit and finish, reliability and because I don't expect you to put bloatware from Game of Thrones or AT&T for a phone that I paid full price for.",5,9/30/19 11:48
476,Amazing phone,"I had originally purchased one of these for my mother, but liked it so much that I ended up getting it for both of my parents. It is very compatible with all of my other apple products and makes work that much easier. I definitely recommend it!",5,12/22/19 10:09
477,Boom!,Yes this is a PHONE! Thank you to Best Buy for transfer service and assistance with seamless installation making new phone better version of everything in old one.,5,1/25/20 11:38
478,Excellent battery life,"I'm happy to have upgraded to this phone mostly because of the speed and battery life.  On a typical day, I still have over 75% battery at the end of the day.  On a day where I am constantly using text, browsers, phone calls, etc., it lasted the entire day without needing to be charged until I was ready to go to bed.  I'm still learning all the features of the phone, but I'm very happy with my purchase thus far.",5,10/12/19 15:14
479,"great phone, but not much change",i upgraded from the iPhone 10 so there really isn't too much of a change for me. the camera is a better quality than previous models as one would expect and the battery seems to last longer. If you have the 10 you may as well not upgrade and wait it out for next years iPhone release as it should have bigger changes/upgrades unless you're just looking to have the newest and latest as i did.,5,10/17/19 17:58
480,AMAZING PHONE,"Have to say,  I was hesitant going from my XS max to pro max thinking it would be about the same phone...

it is, however, the camera and software has been fixed from all my gripes and issues with my xs max 

Its making every photo app so much fun , the quality it produces is simply unreal

everything else from design to new screen/battery life improved also.",5,10/24/19 23:12
481,iPhone 1 Prop MaxGreat item to keep up to date,"Very good service, however it is difficult to learn it on your own,  Need some hands on education for such a complicated instrument.  A good video of the various things you need to know would be very helpful.",5,12/27/19 19:31
482,Love this phone!,I keep my phones for a long time.  So when my iPhone 6 died I looked forward to getting the new iPhone 11 Pro Max.  It’s night and day faster.  The last 2 days.  I charge it every other day.  Camera is great!,5,10/26/19 14:10
483,Huge upgrade!,I went from a 6s to the best phone Apple has made to date. Obviously the camera quality is amazing. The night pics come out beautifully. But what gets me is the battery life. Don’t have to charge for a few days sometimes! All in all it’s a great phone. Feel like I can hang on to this phone for a long time.,5,11/9/19 09:21
484,Love it,Only one thing I found to be a bother when your on speaker there’s feedback in to the other persons phone now the only thing I can think of it’s caused by the new battery using or the speaker wires are to close to it but hey Apple fix it please,5,12/6/19 16:15
485,Another great apple product,"This is my wife's phone. She loves it. The battery life has been great! On days during the work week, I honestly belive she could charge it every other day. Cameras, they are as good as everyone says. Pics are crisp and bright. All in all, this is the most I have concidered leaving my beloved pixel line. Good job Apple.",5,11/2/19 10:22
486,I haven’t had an iPhone within 5 years.,"Switched to iPhone because I like what they are doing with the software and a major plus for me is the battery life. Just from normal use, one charge will last me up to 48 hrs. That’s almost unheard of for a phone. As for the camera, it’s like having a DLSR camera in your pocket, almost that is. Build of the iPhone is great, rock solid, but it is on the heavy side for a phone, but it doesn’t bother me.",5,9/27/19 15:29
487,Amazing upgrade on the camera,"It takes beautiful pictures. My only complaint is that it is heavier than my previous phone the iPhone XS Max.  Right out of the box the 11 Pro Max is way heavier than the XS Max is in a case, and  once I put the pro max in a case it just felt so much heavier. I just put it in my backpack or hold it, it’s not really comfortable having it in your pocket",5,10/18/19 15:55
488,Insane battery life and beautiful,The iPhone 11 Pro Max has the longest battery life I’ve ever experienced in a mobile device. I won give a breakdown as lifestyle and type of usage matters but I will have close  to 70% percent left after the full day. I have zero dead pixels and the HDR OLED screen is just gorgeous. No complaints so far except for AT&T and their backend issues connecting my iWatch to the phone but that’s another story,5,9/27/19 15:21
489,Good but nothing too exciting,I recently upgraded from the iPhone 7 Plus but I don't find the new iPhone THAT exciting. I do like the facial recognition but I hate that I have to pick up my phone and face it directly at my face for it to work. And the camera are cool but nothing I couldn't do by zooming on my old phone...except the wide angle. I do like that. But this phone feels so much bigger in my hand so I am actually exchanging it for the 11 Pro instead of the 11 Pro Max.,4,10/17/19 17:01
490,Love It!,"Traded in my fairly new iPhone X 258 for this iPhone 11 Max Pro 512. It has the bigger screen like the 8+. The battery lasts abut 4 hours longer for me than my X, and the fast charger goes to 80% in about 330 minutes. Awesome. I haven’t used the cameras much, except for the wide-angle for landscapes and a few group selfies. 

I love this new phone. I didn’t need it, but what the heck. LOL",5,9/27/19 15:20
491,Love my new iPhone 11 Pro Max,"This a wonderful update from my iPhone 6. I was happy with the large screen and it worked great until fell into my pool a week before the new version was to be released. So what the heck, why not go for biggest and best. The camera is fantastic! And it is water resistant! But I have no plans on testing that. I like the new OS which is now also on my iPad. Couldn’t live without either.",5,9/28/19 11:18
492,In love with new I phone pro max,"Love love love the new I phone 11 pro max
The ease of operation coming from an I phone e7 max is amazing",5,2/2/20 15:52
493,Switched from Android (Samsung) to Apple,Wife wanted to make the move to Apple and so far loves the new phone.  Obviously had to adjust to some of the new things relating to Apple but have enjoyed the phone and no regrets yet.  I still have my Samsung and not sure if I will convert so will someday need to make that choice when I get a new phone.,5,11/1/19 15:32
494,"Great overall phone, camera is excellent","If upgrading from an iPhone 8 or earlier, the performance and enhanced camera and other capabilities are worth the price. From a later phone, your mileage may vary. The camera would be the main difference there. Phone feels good in the hand and seems like it is not a slippery. Slightly thicker but seems solid, Picture is very clear and phone speakers pack more volume. No complaints.",5,9/27/19 16:32
495,"Nice, but beware of learning curve","The display is a lot better than my old 6S Plus. However I cannot find a case I like in the color I like unless I bought the 11.  It is pretty much the same size and feel as the 6S Plus, so no changes in fitting my inside coat pocket. The only big problem I had was that the tech at my local Best Buy inserted my old sim card instead of the new one. This led to a few hours on the phone with AT&T to figure out why I had no service the next day.",4,12/13/19 22:01
496,Great upgrade over my old phone,Functionality is pretty much the same as my old iPhone but pictures and security are a nice upgrade,5,1/31/20 16:17
497,Best smart phone ever!!,The iPhone 11 pro max is a great smart phone. It’s a little thicker than the last phone but I prefer it better and that means a bigger battery and longer battery life which is absolutely amazing. Everything works so seamlessly smooth and fast that includes Face ID swiping and app response time.  You will not be disappointed and I upgraded from the iPhone XS Max,5,10/3/19 19:28
498,The iPhone 11 Pro Max is worth the upgrade!,"You’ve read about the phone, the screen, the processor and the camera... It’s all true... the iPhone 11 is well worth the upgrade!  In addition, the battery has an unbelievable life!!  Still playing with the camera and it’s ability to switch between wide, normal and telephoto lenses.  The only downer, the phone is expensive...",5,10/18/19 16:33
499,Great phone,I’ve always had IPhones and this one did not disappoint. It’s very sleek and has a great camera.,5,1/31/20 15:36
500,iPhone Phreak,"I initially went in to buy the 64 GB; but realized the store Rep sold me a 256 GB.. I look like we was up working for 72 hours straight, no breaks..

I love my new phone though .. I also bought a watch to match; whoop",5,12/6/19 10:17
501,A fantastic piece of technology,"A definite step forward in the evolution of the iPhone that checks all the right boxes, from build quality to battery capacity and management to camera refinement and image quality. In conclusion, even if high in price, it is the best iteration of the current iPhone design.",5,11/8/19 18:13
502,This is better than the  iphone 10 x,If you liked the  iphone 6 plus this is the same size as this WITH no loss of screen with borders and a button like back then  great looking phone !!,5,1/7/20 17:42
503,10/10 apple does it again,Wonderful upgrade from my previous 8 plus. I am a photographer so I wanted to see exactly how the cameras functioned compared to my DSLRs. Not too shabby! I actually just went on a weekend vacation with just my phone and I was pleased with the quality. The battery life is fantastic and I honestly can’t say anything bad about it!,5,10/11/19 15:18
504,Huge Upgrade from 8 Plus,"I stretched out the life of my iPhone 8 Plus for as much as I could. While this phone doesn't seem to be as big a of leap from the iPhone X, it's a huge difference from the 8 Plus. The three cameras aren't as cumbersome as I thought they would be, and actually serve a great purpose. The phone itself feels great in the hand and looks clean as well.",5,10/1/19 12:50
505,Best Iphone Yet,"The resolution and pictures from this new iphone are state of the art. It is snappier than the previous generation. If you are on the fence about the bigger size, go for it. I have big fingers and this size really has improved my typing experience.",5,11/18/19 08:54
506,Super fast,"Great new phone with lightening speed, great clarity, easy to use, fantastic battery life, sharp pictures, large screen, , and video replay like no other phone sold in the past.  Using this phone makes every detail clearer from sound, to picture, to video! Simply the best IPhone put out on the market to date.",5,10/18/19 18:35
507,Best phone or camera I’ve ever had,"The reasons this phone is awesome 
1 the screen is crisp with true deep rich colors 
2 the camera is the best for so many reasons  too many to get into this review 
3. The sound is so much better than the 8 plus
4. The battery life is awesome 

If you have an iPhone 8 Plus like I did , this is a major upgrade",5,10/18/19 16:10
508,Great Phone,"I upgraded to the iphone 11 Pro Max from the iphone 8 plus and I gotta say i'm pretty impressed. I'm not normally the type that has to have the latest and greatest, but once I saw the camera capabilites on this device I just had to have it. So far I am enjoying the device immensly and can't wait to use it for the next couple of years.",5,10/4/19 22:57
509,Best Phone,Upgraded from an iPhone X and I’m loving it. I love the bigger screen and I get a better cellular signal on this phone. The battery truly lasts all day with consistent usage. The phone is super fast and the camera is spectacular. This is a huge upgrade over the iPhone X for me.,5,10/31/19 10:21
510,iPhone 11 Pro Max 64GB - Gold,"Very nice color but wish I got more GB.  iPhone 11 Pro Max doesn’t have the 128GB which I wanted.  If you take a lot of pictures, better get more GB.",5,1/3/20 18:51
511,Stove top...nah!,"The super wide camera lense is amazing I’ve been able to take great images using it!! I really like the added battery life. My old XS Max lasted just about all day, the 11 Pro Max battery life can still go into the next day and I’ll wake up to it having just a little over 25% battery life ! I’m super happy with this purchase.",5,10/4/19 17:08
512,excellent device,Wife loves her new phone and takes awesome pictures and videos. Lots of storage.,5,2/1/20 09:11
513,Best I phone I’ve had,"So I’m loyal nonetheless to say too Apple but I must say The 11 has the best speaker system it’s ever had, Siri understanding a lot smother. The response time is better across the board. And finally the battery life has lasted me a day and half on a full charge.... YEA I SAID IT",5,10/25/19 16:22
514,Excellent Love the screen,"I watch a lot of video on my phone, always learning new things. The display is the brightest I’ve seen yet with great detail and colors supporting all the hdr content I want. From YouTube to Plex or really any app benefits from this device greatly compared to other models",5,10/28/19 11:40
515,Best in a while,"Really the best iPhone in years. The camera(s) especially. The first time In years that a photo opportunity didn’t make me wish I had my DSLR instead. I was honestly a little disappointed with the iphoneX and wasn’t very interested with the follow up XR and XS, which in retrospect makes me very happy I waited. Good job",5,10/4/19 10:21
516,Great phone,"Upgraded from the Iphone 7plus. Love the Face ID to  unlock the phone. The fingerprint reader was never reliable for me on the 7plus, because my hands are so dry I suppose. Love the new camera lenses and the large display. That being said, I hate that phone are sooo expensive!",5,10/25/19 16:01

521,Just an all-around great phone,Well I didn’t like being pushed into getting a new phone because my 6S was just fine with me but once I got to mess around with this thing I begin to like it a little more so I’ll say so far so good price was a little high for a cell phone but we’ll see how well it goes,5,10/25/19 16:08
522,Camera is Amazing,Before this phone I had the 8s plus and didn’t plan to upgrade until I saw this bad boy and I am so glad I did. This phone is amazing. My battery last ALL DAY and I use my phone a ton. And the camera is so good! The ultra wide lens is so cool! Def worth the purchase.,5,10/26/19 19:55
523,Awesome Phone - Coming from iPhone X,"Battery Life is probably the best part of this phone. Coming from the iPhone X, my battery would be close to dead by 6-7pm. This phone is probably around 60% by then and includes the fast charger. Camera is amazing, and the speed of the phone is great.

Totally worth the upgrade from the X, if you can.",5,10/8/19 13:43
524,Loving the new phone,This is an upgrade from the iPhone 8 Plus. I love the difference from the 8th. I’m still trying to get my way around it with the new update and technique.

527,Great phone from apple,I upgraded from an Apple X max.

528,Love this phone!,The phone is really nice and great quality. Still figuring out the specs but the design is nice and the screen is nice.

583,Best of the best,I had the s10 plus and note 10 plus and even though those phones are great and the camera is awesome the iPhone pro camera is wayyyyy better in color correction as all. You can’t go wrong with the iPhone 11 pro.,5,10/18/19 17:22

585,I miss the bigger memory,"I was convinced by the salesman to go lower in memory because it won’t matter. I had the 128 7plus (I know, it was time to upgrade) and never had memory issues. iPhone decided not to do that model no more and I don’t really need the 256, so I listened to the salesman and went down in memory space. Now I have the “memory full” message all the time. Will go and change it tomorrow",4,11/10/19 22:20
586,Best iPhone Ever,I have read reviews that the iPhone is worth the price just for the the camera features. I could not agree more. And there are a lot more features than I had on my iPhone 10Smax. Terrific phone in all regards!,5,10/19/19 11:04
587,Super fun,First smartphone I ever had so I went for the top one. Very happy with it and highly recommended!,5,12/27/19 16:46
588,"I have some issues, but I’m happy I upgraded","Previously, I had a iPhone 7 Plus and wanted to upgrade, but did not need to. It is a good phone, but it freezes on me multiple times of the day. It also does not like doing multiple things at once. Take for instance when I have my phone connect to Apple car play and using WAYS I can only have 25 - 30 minute phone calls. A lot of the time it refuses to maintain a connection after that and I have to call them back after it hangs up. If it stays on for longer then WAYS stops working and turns itself off. This sucks for me because I’m always on the road. It also likes to disconnect from Bluetooth while I’m in the car (While not plugged into anything) during a call and I have to either try to connect it back to my car or restart my phone. Really that’s all I’ve really had to deal with since I purchased the phone. When it works properly it’s a great phone, but that is rare.",3,12/3/19 11:56

1114,People,"I had a iPhone 7+ which worked well for three years they didn’t want a trade in so purchased a iPhone max cost me a lot said I had 14 days to try it out, for my use of iPhone my older iPhone was fine so I returned it at a cost of 45$ or close, after I got home I played a couple games until my wife got home I told her that I was just going to use my older phone she said “go get the new one you deserve it” so I went back and asked if they still had my returned phone said it was gone I purchased another and asked if they could give me anything for my old phone I just wanted to get a case protection they said yes 180 something like that took my phone and said only if it turns on I wasn’t worried as I used it 1 hour earlier but all the sudden after they took off my protection case? It did not turn on???? I brought it home and found the left side of phone was open I new it would be very hard to explain so I didn’t don’t like to blame someone for something I can’t prove! So I ate the loss but it was very weird that we at the store used it to get my new one going but 10 minutes later it would not turn on?????????",1,1/10/20 18:22

1129,Camera complicated,"The use of the phone camera is ridiculous, if its not broke dont fix it apple. They added so many more was to confuse someone that just wants to take a picture with the flash on without having to press 6 Different options before it finally does what its supposed to. Even then it still ends up doing what it wants not what the user wants",3,10/17/19 16:30

1133,ok product,May be a great product. I was not given an overview of the product or a comparison of others. I was told by the seller that she didn't have time for that. I was desperate for a new phone. Takes a lot of getting used to.,3,12/6/19 17:03

1139,Not a real upgrade,If you have a XS Max then there is no real reason to upgrade unless you simply like having the latest. The cameras are ok but other than that there is nothing special about this phone.,3,9/27/19 15:28

1143,Dealing with battery & heat issues,"My iPhone 11 Max Plus gets hot to the touch very quickly and the battery drains faster than my iPhone 7 Plus. I have tried restoring to factory settings but it didn’t help the issues. 
It is also much heavier than my iPhone 7 Plus.",3,10/11/19 17:39
1144,It’s ok,"I was so excited to get the new phone, I don’t think it’s worth the money. Had a really hard time getting things transferred over. I think it’s more hype than quality",3,11/8/19 15:48
1145,Very similar to iPhone XS Max,I would not upgrade from the XS Max. This phone is such an incremental upgrade and all their efforts were put on the iOS 13 . Which is amazing.  But the camera upgrade; no human can even tell,3,10/18/19 15:50
1146,Camera is buggy,I think the camera has a delay and sometimes freezes as well,3,1/10/20 16:49

1151,Better camera,"Camera is nice but the phone is not shatter resistant, mine broke the next day. So if you’re planning on buying this phone make sure you get a good phone case.",3,10/4/19 16:48

1155,I really like this iphone 11 Pro Max,"I hold on to my phones for as long as I can.  I detest the cost that Apple prices their products at and I would have kept using my iphone 6s if it didn't start to slow down, have issues with latest updates and just plain cranky.  Shame because it was a great little smart phone.  I like that I could buy the iphone outright at Best Buy and I was up and running within minutes.  Lots of new whistles and bells and I adore the camera and what it offers but especially the long batter life.  I can shoot/save video and hundreds of images at an event and still have nearly 80% battery life at the end of of the day.",5,11/16/19 14:32
1156,Cool,It's good and the service is great. I would use att for all my service,5,9/20/19 13:35
1157,Great upgrade,"Upgraded from iPhone X and so happy with this purchase. Best Buy made this an easy transition through my At&T service and had the phone in stock as compared to waiting 3 weeks via At&t. 
The biggest difference I've noticed is the battery life which is pretty amazing and I feel is nearly double from the iPhone X. Lastly the camera takes amazing pics and I've just scratched the surface with using the pic modes.",5,12/5/19 07:29
1158,Bad headache.,"Since the pro models have OLED screens, they have a phenomenon called PWM. You can research it. There is a population of users that suffer from nasty headaches after using these even after a short duration. No only iPhones though. 

Exchanged it for an iPhine 11 and never looked back.",1,11/30/19 23:46
1159,Great smartphone,"This is an excellent upgrade from iPhone 6 s plus. Front and rear Camera takes perfect pictures, battery lasts a day easily, speakers are very good. Screen resolution and size is perfect. Finish of the phone is better than other smartphones.  
I hope Apple also releases a stylus in upcoming models at the same price or less, otherwise I feel it’s expensive phone by couple hundred dollars.",5,11/29/19 10:02
1160,Apple get it Together!,"Before upgrading to this phone, my phone worked perfectly fine. Great reception! Fast loading of websites! 
Then I got this expensive phone... dropped calls left and right! We page doesn’t load, hotspot can’t connect!! I don’t know but maybe wait till they fix all the bugs...",1,11/15/19 16:43
1161,Amazing iPhone 11pro max,As much as I am an Apple iPhone fan. I upgraded from iPhone 7 and the difference is Phenomenal. Battery life and the picture quality is just Superb.

1164,"Very nice upgrade from my old 6s, OBVIOUSLY!!!","This is my first new phone in about 4 years. Definitely liking the larger screen with no home button.

1178,New iphone,"I love my iPhone 11 Pro Max!  I had my iPhone 6 Plus for 5 years and the phone had to be plugged in all the time because even after adding two batteries, phone would not hold a charge!  I did not need all the bells and whistles on this camera since I just take pics of my dogs, but the battery life in this phone is great and processor is very fast!  The screen quality is great too! This iPhone 11 is the same size phone as my 6 plus, but with bigger screen since there is no home button, just face recognition!  It is heavier than the 6 plus, but I am getting g used to it!  I hated to give up my iPhone 6 Plus, but I also wanted a 256 GB and my old phone was only 128!",5,1/15/20 20:34

1182,Phone,Great camera for pictures. Iphones are always user friendly.,5,11/21/19 13:58
1183,Works great,"This is my wife’s phone, and it offers significant advantages over our old 6s’s. First, facial recognition has been flawless not only for the phone, but for apps that accept it. It also is much easier to unlock and use (just look at the face of the phone) than finger print recognition. We also like the fact that we can get a charging pad for it, rather than having to plug and unplug a charging wire. The Apple wires are too short, and the longer 3rd-party ones do not hold up with constant use. The gold color also is quite striking.",5,12/31/19 13:21
1184,Love the ease of use and the camera,"This phone has a longer battery life, camera is amazing, and the phone is sleek and attractive",4,1/4/20 07:47
1185,I Love This Phone!,This phone has a large screen with face recognition and is equipped with 256G of storage. That is plenty enough to store lots of apps and photos. The camera is amazing and the photos even look good in low light. The wide angle lens is an added bonus that comes in handy more than I expected. The reverse camera saves at a high resolution to take quality photos. I bought this phone mainly for the camera and I have not been disappointed.,5,1/11/20 11:38
1186,Best iPhone Ever,"I upgraded from an Apple 6S Plus, and while I thought my old phone was good, this one is amazing.  The battery life is outstanding.  I can go 2 days without a charge, and I use my phone constantly.  The camera is amazing as well.  I highly recommend this phone. It's expensive, but worth it!",5,1/10/20 18:34
1187,Love my new phone.,"Since updating my iPhone X to the 11 Pro Max I am extremely satisfied.  Of course the phone feel and is much larger but not too large.  As a senior with poor eyesight it’s nice to have a larger screen and bigger font sizes.

The best thing is the camera upgrade.  I’m still learning how to use all the camera features but am impressed with the photos I’ve taken so far!",5,12/14/19 00:40
1188,Best so far!,"This year I wasn’t planning to purchase this phone but after watching all the reviews on Youtube I don’t regret my decision.  Same notch and looks since the 10 came out but the performance, battery life and picture quality won me over.  And tbh unless someone is that distracted or is that bothered, 99% of the time the notch doesn’t phase me",5,12/17/19 14:16
1189,Apple iPhone Pro Max 11,"I recently purchased a replacement iPhone. I chose the Apple iPhone promax 11. I believe the biggest improvement for this iPhone is the camera. Especially in low lighting, my sister who also owns an iPhone could not take as good of pictures and little lighting as I could. We experimented. Of course the iPhone is the Cadillac of phones and the rest of the features are intuitive and useful. By the way it makes a pretty good phone toI",5,11/15/19 16:17
1190,Great phone love it,I just upgraded to the iPhone 11 Pro Max today at my local Best Buy store I needed a new phone because I had the iPhone X this first one that came out.

1191,It is better than expected even,Extremely fast and the screen is stunning.  I knew it would take good pictures but just WOW.  The picture quality is unbelievable.  I have tried to take some photos in the dark that I expected to be too dark to use but look amazing.  Glad I made this purchase.,5,12/29/19 07:48
1192,"Great Job, Apple!",This newest generation is beyond my expectations!  I decided it was time to upgrade my five year old 6+ and I decided on this model. The facial recognition alone is pretty amazing plus the camera takes such nice pictures. I haven’t had time to go through all of the tips and tricks. Austin at the Edwardsville IL was outstanding and made everything so easy!,5,11/22/19 18:21
1193,Great camera!,So far I’ve got the phone for about a week and love it! The camera is awesome with all 3 lenses to give you different depths while taking photos. Not having a home button is new to me so it’s an adjustment. So far I love it!,5,1/10/20 16:25
1194,Love the screen!,"Either your an apple person or your not. If you are this phone is great. I upgraded from a 7+ and there are enough features with this model to feel like its worth it, bigger better screen, the 3 cameras, facial recognition, no home button. I thought removing the home button was going to be hard to get used to, but only took about a day, and I don't miss it.",5,11/15/19 18:22
1195,Best iPhone yet,This iPhone I can’t tell you enough good things. I haven’t had an iPhone is 6 years I went Samsung.

1198,Great phone but similar to iPhone XS Max.,I got this phone thinking it was going to have more new features than the iPhone XS Max and well it really doesn’t. I don’t see a huge difference from the pictures with the two either. I did come from using an iPhone 7+ so don’t get my wrong it takes amazing pictures. On some of the apps on the top of the screen where the speaker is it does cut off onto some apps other than that the phone does work nicely.,5,10/4/19 23:26
1199,Excellent design and amazing camera,"I have upgraded from an iphone 6 plus and the difference in performance is night and day!

1424,Great at everything!,"Recently tried my hand with the galaxy S10+, it was a really good phone but I was missing my iPhone.  So I ordered the Pro Max after reading the improvements.  While it looks extremely similar to the last gen iPhone it’s so much more.  The cameras are phenomenal, better than my galaxy by far in pictures and video.  The speed and smoothness of IOS is unrivaled by any operating system I have tried.  Oh and the battery... I can’t believe this is an iPhone, I’m a very heavy user and can make it all day easily without having to worry about having a charger near by.  I was highly impressed with the S10+ battery, the iPhone exceeds what it could do.  I’m not thrilled about the price, but if you’re here you already the iPhone is very expensive.  If you’re on the fence and have the money available just go ahead and do yourself a favor and upgrade.",5,11/1/19 21:31
1425,UNREAL!!!!,"The camera upgrade on the iPhone 11 alone should be enough for anyone to WANT the new iPhone, but there is so much more!!

Faster, more powerful, easier access AND noticeable better battery levels!!!!

But the camera must be used to be fully appreciated!!",5,10/4/19 17:04
1426,The best feeling iphone I have ever owned!,"I upgraded from a I phone x to the iPhone 11 pro max. I wasn’t expecting much of a difference besides the camera, but it turns out that it is a huge difference. I’m a web developer and I do a lot of work on my phone, and the iPhone X would sometimes get sluggish. The iPhone 11 pro max really handles well under pressure, and the quality is overall excellent.",5,9/21/19 20:37
1427,Wow Factor,The camera is superb my dslr has very little if anything on this camera and the usability is amazing,5,9/27/19 15:26

1431,This is just the best,I really love this phone the best purchase I’ve made so far as far as a purchase of a new phone,5,9/30/19 00:01
1432,Definitely the best iPhone to date...that camera,"I was unable to find the iPhone 11 Pro Max anywhere. They were out of stock everywhere ya looked. I was able to locate a few gray ones in 64 GB at the Best Buy in Chapel Hill.

Dylan Seibel was a great help if I may add. He knew all the ins and outs and details to get me the best deal on a trade in / port to Verizon.

Got $450 for my iPhone 8 Plus. Got a $200 MasterCard gift card, and free Unlimited Apple Music for the term of my contract.

Do auto-pay and get another $10 off. Veteran? Get another $15 off monthly.

Can’t beat it.

Oh. And that camera on this model is: Wow. I posted some sample pics I took. Battery: Another wow. Love the OLED super bright screen, too. If you’re on the fence, jump over it. You won’t regret buying the IPhone 11 Pro Max.

Thanks, BestBuy / Verizon / Dylan Seibel.",5,10/4/19 16:38
1433,Yes,It’s a very awesome phone the best one I ever had so far,5,10/25/19 21:38
1434,A lot of the same with some goodies mixed in,"The phone is very familiar if you are A long time iPhone user, the camera is very very good especially video recording in 4K and stabilization, the speakers are top-notch. The battery lasts all day no need to charge which is great. My only gripe with the phone is the weight increase is noticeable and sometimes uncomfortable But I do recommend it",5,10/5/19 14:25
1435,Best iPhone I’ve own,Cameras are amazing for a cellphone battery life is all day and then some screen is bright and crisp well worth the upgrade,5,1/4/20 00:12
1436,Love the camera lenses!,Took this phone as well as my Nikon camera on vacation to Arizona and Nevada. The pictures on the phone were of such great quality that I put away my Nikon and only used the camera on the phone.,5,10/18/19 16:40
1437,LOVE IT!!!,"I typically don't upgrade in a year, but I wanted to upgrade to the phone from my XS Max Plus due to the added camera features before my trip to Iceland.  I'm so glad that I did.  The picture quality is amazing!!!!  Love that the 10 second low light exposure feature allowed me to get decent shots of the Northern lights.  I cannot get over the quality of photos this phone has!  No regrets!",5,11/12/19 11:08
1438,Fantastic upgrade that is surprisingly worth it,"Coming from an iPhone XS Max, I didn’t to be wowed by the iPhone 11 Pro Max. But after using it for a couple of weeks, I have really appreciated the improvements that have been made. The battery life is the best I’ve seen in an iPhone. I’m getting whole day battery life with the screen brightness at 1/5 the bar, a big improvement to the XS Max which I kept the brightness lower. The cameras are also greatly improved, which the ultra wide lense and Night Mode have made taking pictures more fun and satisfying. The front camera finally brings a wider camera making group pictures much easier to frame. The loss of 3D Touch is unfortunate as I really enjoyed using it in different ways, but I would rather sacrifice it if it means we continue to have much larger batteries going forward. The other differences such as the newer processor aren’t really noticeable but are likely important for more strenuous tasks and device longevity. Finally, the midnight green color is great.

Honestly I don’t think everyone should upgrade to this iPhone if their current iPhone is working fine. I upgraded because I lack self control and like having the latest, greatest iPhone. But if you are moving from a 8 or older, you’re in for a treat.",5,9/29/19 22:50
1439,Battery Life and Camera’s are top notch!,"I jump back from Android and iPhone fairly often. I feel confident that iPhone 11 Pro Max is sticking around for a while. The battery life is amazing! It’s one thing to hear about it, but another to see it in action! The battery lasts all day and that’s with me checking Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter pretty often along with using FaceTime and YouTube. I only need to charge when going to bed, but if I needed to charge because I’m heading somewhere the fast charging is super fast. Coming from a Pixel 3XL I’m no stranger to fast charge, but this seems much faster. 
Oh and the Camera’s. They are so great! I was apprehensive about leaving my Pixel’s camera behind especially with family moments and young kids, but the iPhone camera is really amazing. And the night shot feature is really good as well! 
The phone itself is iPhone. iOS, icons, notch, etc. none of those things are negatives for me, but consider that too when choosing between camps. 
Oh 1 more thing... the sound!! So loud and very good with the 3D feeling of the sound. It’s all software I’m assuming, but those speakers had me turning left and right even when watching a YouTube video! Great speakers! I thought I would miss forward facing speakers on my Pixel, but these are so good and loud!",5,9/27/19 16:02
1440,Very happy with this phone.,"I upgraded from an XR and can say this phone was a nice upgrade over that model and really enjoy using this phone.

The screen looks nice and pictures are awesome, but the real story here is the battery life. While the XR had great battery life the 11 Pro Max has phenomenal battery life. Apple has always done a great job  with standby battery usage, but the battery would drop quickly with heavier usage. The XR was better, but this Pro Max does not have that issue at all. I believe it is a combination of the larger battery and A13 chip efficiency. Consumer reports is reporting 40 hours of simulated user usage with the Pro Max versus 29 hours with the XS Max. 

This was an upgrade I was on the fence about, and honestly did it so I could pass the XR to my son. I had planned to wait until next year. 5G is not a big deal for me and my son needs a phone now. I also needed the 2x zoom on the camera. I like the 11 Pro Max has the lightning connector also since I have other devices that have the same connection. I can say the battery life and camera made the upgrade worth it. I am also glad I sprung for the 512 GB version because I am going to keep this phone for a while.",5,10/5/19 03:18
1441,Another Great Release,I’ll admit that I remain an Apple fan due to everything working well together and for it just fits my needs. This new one is definitely faster and new iOS makes it more intuitive. Camera is definitely better than the already good on in the XS Max and battery life is definitely better. Holds up after heavy use all day so far. If you want better battery life and camera upgrades this is headed in the right direction. iPhone XSMax pictures are amazing and who wouldn’t want longer battery without having to use battery packs.,5,9/23/19 00:33
1442,Its All About Preference,"I used to work in the mobile section at best buy (between 2015 and 2018) and the iphone honestly hasnt evolved too much since around the iphone 6s. This isnt a bad thing honestly. Instead of striving for innovation they strive for perfection. The iphone is sleek, clean, and easy to use where as android is complex and customizable. When looking to purchase this phone I would base off what you currently have and what youre looking for. Iphone is very surface level and android lets you dive deep. At this point in the phone game it falls to preference. Both are great but I prefer iPhone and the apple ecosystem.",5,12/26/19 16:03
1443,iPhone 11 Pro Max,"I originally wanted the Midnight Green but they sold out, so settled for the Space Gray, and I love it, my iPhone 10 Max was Space Gray as well. The battery life on this is the truth, I can literally get a entire day out it, and that’s including watching videos, playing games, and Surfing the web and social media, and Apple including the 18watt battery charger which is THE TRUTH meaning it WORKS I was like 13% late one night I plugged in the 18 watt charger And went from 13% to like 35% in like 15 minutes , IOS 13.1",5,9/27/19 16:48
1444,Superior Customer Service,"The phone is amazing, as normal with Apple, but this post is more about my experience than the product. Best Buy sent me a great offer to trade in my iPhone X to get direct credit towards the purchase of an 11 Pro if I preordered. They gave me a great offer for my trade in, so I went ahead and accepted the offer. When I went to pick up my new phone, it refused to activate, and ended up being a system issue on. Verizon’s side. To make a long story short, I was in the store for about 5 hours while the mobile team did everything in their power to try and resolve the issue, but they were unable to. We ended up having to cancel the order and reorder a different phone. The perseverance and customer service that everyone from the mobile team showed me was AMAZING, and despite the frustration with the activation issue, I am even more loyal to Best Buy because of their hard work and great attitudes. Thank you to Lauren, Mikeah (spelling?), and Store Manager Tim.",5,10/13/19 16:43
1445,All around GREAT iPhone! Worth the upgrade.,"Coming from the iPhone XS Max makes this upgrade not as big as coming from an older model such as the 6S or 7,8 Plus however I’m still glad I upgraded. 
You can see the deeper contrast in the screen compared to the X, and XS. The cameras are amazing and the battery life is GREAT! depending on your use, I’ve been able to go two days without charging. The speed and smooth operation of the phone is what can be expected with a new iPhone and A13 chip. If you have an older plus model or even the X or XS I would definitely upgrade if you can afford it. Reception is also better than the XS Max.",5,10/5/19 23:08
1446,Great camera,"easy to Use
Good camera
Nice sounds
But heavy..
Thats the only thing i dont like with this..
But all in all is good",4,12/13/19 17:34
1447,The iPhone 11 Pro Max is great.,"Short and sweet the phone is great.  I was impressed to see how fast and easy it was to set up.  That is once I got past an issue.  The phone I wanted, in Space Gray, was not in stock at the Best Buy store and had to be mailed to me.  It turned out the the Verizon SIM card that was included could not be recognized.  A Best Buy Support rep tried to help me and was unsuccessful.  I have to go to my local Verizon store to get help with the problem.  Turns out they only had to swap the SIM from my current phone to the new iPhone and subsequently everything went well with the setup.  Then came the next issue when I found that I couldn't make calls and would get a Verizon error message that the account was not active.  Fortunately a quick call to Verizon had this problem resolved.  I don't know why the Verizon support rep didn't think to check on that.",5,10/5/19 13:13
1448,From android to iphone,"My family have converted me to a IPhone user. I have been team android for many years. It was time for an upgrade so I finally convert to Apple. I am very please so far it has only been a week using my iPhone 11 pro max. I am still trying to navigate using this iPhone. It takes some getting use too not having an actual back button and the actual vibrate option. That is the reason for my rating of average on the ease of use.
Overall, once I become comfortable with using the iPhone I sure I will be please and never go back to an android phone.",5,12/6/19 15:44
1449,Loveeeee,"I’ll be honest when this phone first came out I hated it & thought the 3 cameras were ugly but then I warned up to it and it’s perfect
Not too sure on all the camera features but it dies take amazing pictures especially at night time.. we the flash it doesn’t even look like it was completely dark",5,2/1/20 10:29
1450,Nice upgrade for 8+ and x users,"I have an XR on my business phone and would say that this is a small upgrade from last years phones unless you are a camera person. So upgrading from a XS,XSM, or XR is less likely that you will see huge improvement or need to upgrade. The one big difference I saw from my iPhone X is the battery life on the pro max is fantastic. I pull my phone off the charger before going to bed and I can still get through a whole day work day and not needing a charge until around 9-10pm. I would consider myself a power user as throughout the day I have emails, spreadsheets, and YouTube streaming in the background for 4-5 hours amongst other items. The cameras are a big improvement and really close the short fall they had in low light photography. The iPhone went from not competing in low light to trading blows with what is considered the best camera on a smartphone the google pixel. I can honestly say I’m not regretting my purchase and if you have a iPhone X or later the small improvements will make you happy with your purchase.",4,10/4/19 22:23
1451,Fantastic Product!,"This is a premier product. The wide angle lens is one of the original wide angle lenses and really adds the ability to get The Big picture. I've been wanting that feature for a while and comes in handy when you just can't backup any further due to obstructions. As for the other two lenses and the overall camera quality, it's fantastic.

I own other phones as well. Android is great, but if stability in updates is what you want, and you want the updates to keep coming - you can't beat Apple.

Remember this - Apple produces the OS and the iPhone. The two are mated together and maintained to high standards.",5,11/15/19 17:13
1452,best Iphone yet,"I have been using an iPhone 8plus and was very happy with everything , once this product was launched I just wanted to see one and experience the screen and camera. Let me say that if you do not have an iPhone X or above then you are missing out 
the screen is amazing and the new bionic chip makes using the phone and apps feel like the first time I used an iPhone, it is that much better. Last if you are not using best buy for all you electronic needs you need to switch and really look into what they do and how good their customer service is.  Apple has out done themselves!",5,11/22/19 16:21
1453,Upgraded from iPhone 8 Plus,"I have had this phone for about two weeks now and so far it’s been great.  I upgraded from an iPhone 8 Plus.  The screen has better resolution, the camera is great (for a phone).  One of the main things I like about the new phone is that it’s the size of my old iPhone 8 Plus but with a larger screen that’s sharper.  I have also noticed this phone is a tad quicker to load apps with the new processor.

One thing that I thought was going to be a problem for me is the lack of the home button on my other iPhones, but I was able to adjust after a day of using the phone.  Also the Face ID feature is a cool update and I have adjusted to this.

I would recommend this phone, just wish apple would calm down with the prices!",5,10/20/19 19:34
1454,Worth the Upgrade,First off S/O to Best Buy for not only having the phone in stock but having in my case Verizon experts in store. I’d like to start off by saying that the phone exceeded my expectations. As we all know phones nowadays are pretty much the same each year with minor updates (Android or Apple).As this may be true for this year’s model it still surpasses all previous generations. From the OS to the fast charge and yes even the obvious. The three cameras on the back which for me (a loyal phone photographer) is my favorite feature and update. The camera quality is beyond amazing. Anyway before I keep going on about how great this phone is go on in and buy one for yourself you wont regret it!,5,10/26/19 05:36
1455,New to Apple,"I’ve been an Android user and this is my first Apple product. The switch is very easy, I find most everything to be very intuitive and user friendly. I can’t wait to dive into the triple cameras and see what I can create. The phone is very stout and feels expensive... and it is.",5,1/31/20 15:49
1456,The cameras make it unbelievable,"I purchase a new iPhone every year and every year I am amazed at what Apple does with every new upgrade. Granted, some people say that some upgrades have been ho hum but this year Apple has come across with some game changers. The first big change is the cameras, they have to be experienced to be believed. The battery life is over the top improved. For most of my previous iPhones I purchased a battery case because they didn’t quite make it through the day but that won’t be necessary with this one. This phone has at least 30% battery at the end of a very heavy day of use. If you are an iPhone person, you have to seriously consider this one, it’s a true joy to behold.",5,10/4/19 18:59
1457,Love the iPhone 11 Pro Max,"I upgraded so that my husband could have my “old” iPhone X. The biggest change in this new phone was the three cameras, but I haven’t used the special features that much. This one also has the bigger screen, which I love because it’s much easier for me to see and text on. I’m a big fan of Apple products because they all connect to one another and that makes it easier for me to sign into websites and apps across multiple devices. The price is high of course, but I was able to use some of my Best Buy rewards to help with that.",5,10/26/19 16:34
1458,A new adventure from Androis,I've owned a Samsung Galaxy from the first one they made.  I was very disappointed with the 7th generation but lived with it for several years.  I finally moved over to an iPhone and am very pleased with it.  The battery lasts forever!  The FaceTime feature is fun.  The only downside it that I had my Android completely customized with ringers and notifications for specific people in my contacts.  I highly recommend this phone!,5,11/22/19 18:04
1459,Loving It,By far the best iPhone I have had (it should be since it is the newest one) but what really impresses me is the extremely long battery life (I normally drain my battery by the afternoon because I am a heavy user of the phone but this phone lasts two days before I need to charge it) and the low light ability of the camera. I have been using Verizon with this phone and I now have better service with this phone and am getting 165 mbps on 4G LTE in some areas. It really is a great phone and is super fast.,5,10/30/19 09:19
1460,Overall best iPhone ever!!!,"I have had both iPhone and android phones and i continue to come back to iPhone. Overall great built. Sturdy in hand and cameras are AMAZING!!! Great pictures no matter the lighting. Priced a bit high but as they say, you have to pay to play.",5,10/11/19 19:14
1461,Awesome Phone,"I upgraded from a iPhone 7 plus to a iPhone 11 Pro Max and it is a big difference.  I had an adjustment with the 11 and no home button.  The quality of the camera is phenomenal.  However I did notice the 11 is slightly heavier than my 7 plus, but the size is the same.  I do like the fact that you don't have to press the home button twice to get all the open apps.  On the 11, you just swipe up on your bottom tool bar and all the apps that are open appear.  Overall I am thrilled with the 11.",5,10/26/19 11:04
1462,Unbelievable battery life!!!,"Absolutely love this phone!! Camera is mind blowing and best of all, you get all day heavy battery life and that’s #1 to me!",5,9/21/19 17:02
1463,Best I phone yet!,"Such an amazing product from Apple. Of you’re on the fence about upgrading take my advice and do it ! The camera, the battery, the specs... all of it is worth the buy.",5,1/31/20 18:47
1464,A nice upgrade!,"I upgraded an iPhone 8+ to the iPhone 11 Pro Max and I’m thoroughly enjoying it. The camera quality is excellent, It’s very fast,  and feels very nice in the hand",5,9/20/19 16:26
1465,so far we love it,the camera is why we decided to upgrade and so far we are not disappointed.... i just hope the battery life stays as good as it is now. a few changes make for a little bit of a learning curve and alot of youtube watches to figure out how to do simple things and im not happy it does not come with the headphone/ charge combo jack and that i have to buy it on my own... for 1500 it should be included.... but thats apple for ya...,5,10/25/19 19:16
1466,so far its great,the camera is why we decided to upgrade and so far we are not disappointed.... i just hope the battery life stays as good as it is now. a few changes make for a little bit of a learning curve and alot of youtube watches to figure out how to do simple things and im not happy it does not come with the headphone/ charge combo jack and that i have to buy it on my own... for 1500 it should be included.... but thats apple for ya...,5,10/25/19 19:15
1467,Upgrade from iPhone XS Max,"I had the silver iPhone XS Max and was going to skip this iPhone 11 Pro Max, but the cameras and sound quality is much better. I loved my XS Max, but I love this iPhone even more. For me I want the best quality in cameras, but if that does not matter to you, you may want to wait until next year. However, the battery life on this thing is astounding! A but heavier and thicker than last year, but that's what we wanted to get a bigger battery!",5,10/20/19 09:07
1468,Great Iphone.,Best iphone ever.  Improved face id. Fast processor. Great green Matt finish.  IOS13 is great.  Switch from S10 plus.  Only negative is too heavy which gives limited case. Also slightly wider than S10 plus.,5,1/15/20 17:20
1469,It's good but...,"I switch back and forth between iPhones and Galaxy Notes. There are Pros and Cons with both. I LOVE iPhones because they just work! Hardly ever bugs. My work apps run faster and smoother. I just always have 100% confidence in the device. But the Cons from switching from the Note 9, this thing is heavy. It's really heavy compared to the Note 9. And it's also big. I'm a big guy with pretty big hands and I can't comfortably reach all corners with one hand. But this thing works so well that the Pros out weigh those Cons. It's not perfect but I'm happy with it.",4,12/11/19 19:42
1470,Apple has continued!!,"I have had Samsung and apple. I know both are constantly competing. For me, iPhones have always been my favorite. This phone is no different. From the facial recognition to the camera to the speed of loading. This phone has been spectacular.",5,12/31/19 17:15
1471,Wow,"I am not a ""fanboy"" of either Apple or Samsung, In fact, I own Motorola, OnePlus, and even Essential devices. It was not my intention to purchase this upon my BB visit. However, I am very pleased I did. The camera and its features are terrific. The build quality is what you would expect from Apple, outstanding. No lag moving through apps. Pricey=absolutley. Disappointment with the value=absolutley not.",5,10/26/19 09:53
1472,"Awesome phone. Best Buy sale price, too",The is a great phone. I took advantage of Best Buy's sale price plus the trade in allowance for my iPhone 7 Plus. Stephen at the mobile counter made sure that everything was transferred from my old phone before wiping it out.,5,1/3/20 16:40
1473,Excellent phone. Great camera and snappy performan,"Upgraded from a 6s, so of course I am impressed. My wife wanted me to update so I could send better photos of our son, and this phone definitely does not disappoint. While the camera appears to be the main marketing point, the phone itself performs great. It takes some getting used to the lack of home button, but the facial recognition seems to take care of any delays for unlocking the phone. Very happy with my upgrade",5,10/18/19 16:13
1474,iPhones-they just work great!,"We’ve been using iPhones for years, and it was way past time for an upgrade.  My wife and each upgraded our phones at the same time, and really enjoy these latest models",5,1/24/20 16:27
1475,Best iPhone ever,"I love this new iPhone.  I traded in my iPhone 7Plus and it was worth the upgrade. 

The triple lens camera with night mode, 4K video are amazing, and of course the speed is sweet. The updated Face ID has been I joy. You can lie it down and it reads your Face ID smoothly.  The missing items was reverse charging and 5G, but the 5G is still new maybe by 2021 it will be more mainstream.",5,10/26/19 00:34
1476,good but I like my iphone X better,"it is a good cell phone but if you need to upgrade from iPhone X ?
I don't know. I still did not find anything really better than iPhone X. I guess it is just the way apple make their business. every year new generation iPhone and people spend money to get the newest one",4,12/20/19 16:51
1477,Great overall phone,I switched from Samsung to Apple.  I loved my Samsung but find the iPhone to be more intuitive.  I haven’t used the camera feature yet but am going to travel soon and am looking forward to using it.,5,12/28/19 08:16
1478,Great simple upgrade over iPhone XS Max,"Great simple upgrade over iPhone XS Max, really happy that they finally listened to consumers, and increased battery life at the expense of thickness and weight. Great choice imo",5,1/4/20 15:31
1479,I expected more,"iPhones are great, don’t get me wrong. The battery life on this phone is phenomenal and the camera is pretty awesome too, but, it has some downfalls. The day after I purchased the phone my notification sounds were glitchy a few times which was odd to me. I’ve never had that happen before with any other model and I’ve had almost every one. Just today my phone froze and shut off which, also, never happened before. I’m not sure if i just got a wonky one or what. I’m an iPhone lover and I have to have the latest one but I’m a little disappointed with this release. It’s very similar to the last phone.",4,11/2/19 02:55
1480,Fancy. I had a 6S and this is a major improvement,"This phone is bigger in every way. Sound, feel, weight, power, battery life. Great stuff. I will coddle it for another several years as I did with the one I had. I wiped the other one and will use as a big iPod for the car/house.",5,12/10/19 17:11
1481,Phone that is at first a phone,"If you want a phone that you can access voicemail, depend on applications not crashing and have the fastest phone tested to be faster than even the new Snapdragon 855 chipsets, this is the phone. It will not overheat, it will not crash and you get your phone and voicemail with some sense of privacy. Nothing new here, if you have one already though you only get a better camera.",5,10/4/19 20:11
1482,Best iPhone ever,"I’ve been buying iPhones since the 3G model back in 2008. If you are a fan of iOS or Apple products in general this one doesn’t disappoint. I moved from an iPhone X to this one and feel it is worth the upgrade. The camera is excellent, the OLED screen is fantastic. Watching HDR video is like watching one of the LG OLED 4K TVs.",5,10/25/19 16:25
1483,Amazing new iPhone,"Absolutely love the distinctive new design and the new cameras! Battery life is also significantly better compared to the iPhone XS max. Overall a great upgrade. I would highly recommend the iPhone pro max! I also love Best Buy‘s upgrade experience, it’s  super easy and convenient compared to going to the phone store.",5,10/25/19 15:51
1484,The best !,Traded in my pixel 3 and best decision I’ve made. The battery last forever and the camera is so good.,5,2/2/20 08:58
1485,Great Camera,"The updates on the camera make me feel, and the end product look, like the pictures are taken professionally.  The portrait option has just gotten better and gets better with every upgrade in IOS.  It’s an Apple product so I wouldn’t expect anything but the best, especially for the price that is paid, but it is worth every penny.",5,10/18/19 23:45
1486,BEST iPhone YET!!,"I had to replace my iPhone 6 Plus and went with the latest and best iPhone.  Very thin, excellent design and picture taking is great.  Will recommend for anyone.",5,1/6/20 16:32
1487,Great camera,great phone to replace my old one that is broken. Love the new camera in it. Fantastic pics captured,5,2/3/20 19:09
1488,Best iPhone yet!!!,"I decided to get a new phone on release day, and I am so happy!  The phone itself has great battery life, a wonderful screen and the camera is just unbelievable.  The camera is so good that I now regret lugging around an expensive mirrorless rig.  I took a shot of a sunset that blows people away, especially when I tell them it’s from my iPhone.",5,10/11/19 19:39
1489,Super,I love the new iphone 11 pro max. The picture quality is amazing. Night shots look as if they were taken in daytime. Everything is super clear on it. I thought the iphone X was pretty good until I got the chance to see the difference the 11 makes. There is a learning curve with the 11. It's not cheap but the trade-in made it more affordable.,5,10/12/19 02:10
1490,very fast,"first time I have a Max or big iPhone, I was more incline to the small phones specially since I carry them in my pockets and run with it...
but lately start to do many thing in my phone almost not use the iPad any more, since the phone is at hand always.. chose this one .. no disappointment .",5,11/2/19 13:38
1491,The camera is phenomenal,"This is the best iPhone yet, the camera is fast enough to capture my adorable impatient toddler!",5,1/31/20 15:15
1492,Amazing Phone,Amazing phone but I will never buy another phone online from Best Buy. Finally got the phone to work today after calling Verizon and waiting on hold 40 min. All the iPhone 11s Best Buy had we’re set for the wrong Activation date 5 days later. I love Best Buy but this was a terrible Experience. Had I traded in my phone I would not have had a working phone for days!!!!,5,9/27/19 18:13
1493,Bought the first day,I had been waiting anxiously for this release.  I bought it the first day at Best Buy. No wait and no line.  It has met my expectations so far.,5,9/28/19 15:25
1494,If you need a larger screen this is it,"I wanted a larger phone and have been using apple devices for a while.  It's heavier than the older, smaller phones but if you know IOS there is not much else to say.  The new cameras take excellent pictures and video.  It's too soon to comment on battery life, but like the other phones I've had this is a solid device.",5,10/17/19 16:48
1495,Another amazing device from Apple,"Upgraded from the X Max and don’t regret it one bit! The camera is unlike any camera that has graced the iPhone. Battery life is definitely an improvement from last years model (my biggest reason for wanting to upgrade). Love the midnight green coloring. Like always, apple has created a gorgeous device that works seamlessly with the IOS software.",5,10/4/19 16:50
1496,Great new features,My husband was having problems with his IPhone 6 keeping a charge. But new batteries would not get him new features and a better camera . He loves his new iPhone 11 ProMax. The pictures are terrific . It is so easy to use. Still learning all of the new features. So glad for the “11”.,5,11/2/19 15:09
1497,Do not regret this purchase,"Really cannot speak highly enough about this phone. Finally switched over from years of Android OS phones. Everything, from the watch and the AirPods, works so flawlessly with one another comparative to Android based systems. Not quite as customizable as Android, but it’s worth the sacrifice, in my opinion.",5,10/18/19 15:53
1498,Excellent upgrade,Camera is fantastic really leaving little to no need for a dslr camera.  Phone is big but manageable.  iOS 13 has some upgrades that are advantageous such as night shots.  Overall the price is high and not necessarily worth spending that much each year but last phone was iPhone 6S+ so this is an excellent upgrade.,5,10/13/19 10:17
1499,Very Beautiful Phone,"At first when I saw all the photos of the phone online, I feared that I wouldn’t like the design. But when you get the phone and look at it in person it’s beautiful. Other than a few iOS 13 glitches, the phone overall is wonderful. The camera is as amazing as advertised. If you have an older iPhone and you’re looking to upgrade, this phone is a good choice.",5,9/22/19 12:13
1500,"A week in, it's performing as advertised.","A week in, the pricey device is performing as advertised--fast, crisp graphics, and even a slowfie / slofie shot taken for kicks and giggles turned out like I gather a slowfie / slofie should.  Still getting used to Face ID (not a fingerprint) opening up apps and saving passwords, but I'm optimistic that'll become second nature soon enough.",5,9/28/19 07:48
1501,Great phone,I wasn’t planning on getting a new phone but was impressive with the oled screen. I’m not a fan of the bigger phones so I preferred the max. Don’t waste your money on 64gb. Pay up and get the extra storage. You are gonna want to use this phone for what it’s built for: high quality videos and photos. Video games,5,10/11/19 20:34
1502,iPhone 11 Pro Max,"Let me say I, along with my family, are Apple people. With 4 iPhones, 3 MacBook Pros, three iPads, and an Airport Time Capsule, we like Apple. As for the newest iPhone 11 Pro, not so good. The screen and camera are great, when they work correctly. IOS 13 has been plagued with issues since receiving the phone. I’m sure Apple is active in correcting the issues, but personally I believe they released it too soon. Due to the issues I’ve had, sadly I can’t recommend it as of yet. Any phone is only as good as it’s operating system, which sadly hasn’t been that great...",4,10/18/19 15:53
1503,iPhone 11 Pro Max,Wow!  I am enjoying and getting acquainted with my new iPhone 11 Pro Max.  Photography is my thing so I am experimenting.,5,1/15/20 20:09

1505,Avid Apple,This by far is one of my best purchases by far. Buy it as Best Buy made it so much less painless then to go into the Verizion store and deal with all the bs,5,12/27/19 16:42
1506,Great Phone,same as other IPhones.. I haven’t found anything too overly impressive other than satisfaction of having the latest phone,5,1/15/20 00:47

1508,Enthusiast level iPhone.,"I upgraded from a 256gb X. I justified the upgrade by getting the Pro Max instead of just the Pro. So far, I am loving everything about the pro max. Highly recommend.",5,12/20/19 15:24
1509,Great phone.,Great phone but needs instruction manual to enjoy it’s features.  No instructions were given by the sales person.,5,1/17/20 16:24
1510,Great phone!,Coming from Samsung to Apple I had my doubts but I love my iPhone. The screen resolution and the speed are amazing. The 3 cameras had me off at first but if you’re into photography than it’s a great thing! Great pictures and video. I got the 256gb and that is plenty! No complaints here and glad to be on team Apple.,5,10/4/19 15:29

The notch at the top, is there one? LOL I don't even notice it. Super happy with my new phone.",5,9/28/19 11:19
1525,Best iPhone I’ve owned...,"I upgraded from a 7s to the 11 Pro Max, in large part due to the improved cameras but have been impressed with the enhanced battery life and speed of the processor.

1526,Nice upgrade,"Camera is the primary reason I upgraded my phone, the camera is super nice although I’m still having to learn what features it has… I did have a little bit of trouble with the screen protector that I ordered, it was blocking a sensor so I thought something was wrong with my phone but it was actually the screen protector. The man at the Apple store just recommended that I not even use one since the glass is so strong.The only reason for four stars instead of five is the cost is somewhat ridiculous. What you get though, it was expected.",4,10/13/19 14:44
1527,Great Phone!,Lightning fast processor.  Plus easy to use camera for beginners but with many sophisticated features for the more advanced users.

1528,Awesome phone,Awesome phone The cameras really nice the pictures come out awesome,5,1/31/20 16:51
1529,Really it's just another iphone,"I read these reviews and see a very common theme in what's been left forbothers to read, "" great upgrade"", "" love the new features especially the camera"". Let's be really honest here it's the exact same phone that has came out over the last 3 years, pretty much since the ""limited edition"" iPhone x, which ended up not being limited at all and became the current apple standard. It's what to expect from apple, luxury build quality great display, Thanks Samsung!! Or LG for the cheaper models. The only difference really is the cameras which is only catching up to what the Google pixel kicked off with the low light phenomena bringing crystal clear pics in the darkest settings apple of course dumps every high end part available right down to the screws I'm sure are dipped in unicorn sweat just because why not as for a great upgrade not really at all if you bought a iPhone in the last 2 years save your money your not missing anything at all except the capability not to upgrade to iOS 13, there some pretty major flaws and privacy concerns surrounding this build so if your one of the smart ones who hasn't upgrade I would continue not to if I where you at least for a few months when all the security issues are patched that being said in display touch id, 5g and sure to be revolutionary camera upgrades are all to come in the iPhone 12 and from what I've heard and read there's some really exciting groundbreaking and a complete build overhaul coming so if coming from say iPhone 8 then this is for you iPhone X and up hang on to your cash after all this will be obsolete in 6 months by apples standards at least hold off for the next round because 1500 dollars plus for a couple camera upgrades and USB C charging finally is not worth the cost of a decent car",3,10/4/19 23:20
1530,Best of the best,"Picked this up for the wife.  She wasn’t planning on upgrading this year, but after using mine and seeing the photo quality from the cameras she decided she needed one as well",5,12/6/19 15:17

I upgraded from an iPhone 6 Plus and find the face recognition along with a bigger screen to be a great feature. Apple made it super easy/seamless to migrate from my iPhone 6, everything transferred wirelessly. I'm also loving the swipe keys feature and all the other new updates now that iOS 13 is stable.

I don't actually use the camera all that often so it would be nice if they made some enhancements to the rest of the device as well.  This green is superb though. 

This is my first iPhone as I have been an Android user with Samsung phones.  All in all - I like the iPhone but miss some of the quality of life features Android offers and the freedom to customize to my liking and not how Apple thinks I will like it.  I really just wish Apple let their users customize their device more.  It's a shame because the hardware is outstanding.",3,9/30/19 06:02

2109,Microphone and camera issues,"This is a beautiful phone in the midnight green but comes at a price. There are quirks that have no fix right now. While using the speaker, or Bluetooth in the car, the sound is like an echo with airplane noises. I’ve tried everything and the only thing that helps is to turn the volume down very low but then I can’t hear my caller. The camera utilizes widescreen on the back camera so while FaceTiming, the other person sees distortion of plus Yiu can see pixels as you move the phone around. Lastly, it took five hours to get service at the store. It took a Samsung expert to help the manager by suggesting to swap out the new SIMS card, which was defective. Unless you get this phone on sale, which I did, I would wait to see if the microphone and widescreen distortion gets fixed. Not a happy camper and thinking of returning within the 14-day exchange since I feel this phone is defective.",1,12/6/19 16:29

2125,Great camera and battery life,I would recommend this phone just for the battery life upgrade. I had an iPhone 7plus and battery life was only a couple of hours. I love the new screen and quick access to my apps.,5,1/4/20 14:27
2126,I’m glad I stuck with Apple,I’m glad I stuck with Apple. I was pondering between the pixel four and the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max. Looks like pixel four is a bust even though it takes good pictures. I’m glad I stuck with apple seems to be a very solid phone great speed it looks Keep growing on me.,5,11/15/19 16:53
2127,Great phone,"Phone is good and pictures are awesome.  One down side is not having a home button.  I have an iphone for a long time and they have always had the home button.  I find my self trying to click on the home button, that's no longer there.  Opening the phone and closing open programs are all done by sliding up.  Iphone 11 is a big learning curve from the iphone 8 plus.  I do like all the features that are available with the camera.",4,12/3/19 19:25
2128,If you want a good Smartphone go Android,"I've had this phone for just over a month so I feel like I've had enough time to really give a fair judgement: The phone is fine. It's a good smartphone and does what a smartphone is intended. 

But my god does this phone feel like such a drag after using android and pixel. 

The camera quality on my two year old pixel is way better than this new iphone and it was able to do more. This iphone camera feels very limiting. The pictures are sub-par quality. They're fine if you take casual photos but if you're trying to take something nice then forget it. 

It had trouble with wifi no matter where I'm at. In fact it seems like Wifi only slows it down! I had the same issue the last time I had an iphone so at this point I think it's an apple problem. 

I could go on but there is just almost no quality in this phone where an android or pixel isn't better. 

And then the price is ridiculous! You pay more for a phone that's just okay. 

If you want to get your money's worth then go for the samsung galaxy or google pixel. Not only are they usually cheaper but they are loads better and can do more. At this point iphone is more of a fashion accessory or status symbol.",3,11/27/19 08:49
2129,Love it!,"Size is great. Camera awesome!  Midnight Green looks more like gray. Color is not vibrant but the user does not look at the back much anyway. So fast, easy to find what I need. Keeps charge so well!",5,11/16/19 08:14

2142,Huge Upgrade,"I didn’t realize how much of the scene was missing from my pictures until I started using the ultra wide camera lens. It should come standard on all flagships! The camera system is absolutely amazing. I am really impressed with Night Mode. The OLED display is stunning, and I love Dark Mode in iOS 13! I thought I would miss Burst Mode, but I think I like taking Slofies more. I also like the added ability to adjust settings within Apple’s Camera app. Despite all the complaints about iOS 13, I have had very few problems, much less than I did with any of the Android smartphones I had a few years ago. The only major thing I don’t like about iPhones is the high price.",5,1/1/20 13:24
2143,Great phone!,Love the new 11 Pro Max. Camera takes awesome pictures. Battery lasts a long time!,5,11/26/19 13:08

I love the size of my 11 Pro Max, the quality of the camera, the speaker phone works great and I dearly love the 512 GB storage and the large size of the screen!  I don’t miss touching the button at the bottom, you just swipe upwards on the line (same thing!).  
When Best Buy had this phone on sale for a Christmas sale, I ordered it immediately!  Verizon sale was buy one/get one (a lesser phone), but I did not need 2 phones/2 lines and the 1st phone was full price.  Best Buy was there for me again!!",5,1/4/20 04:14
2145,The best phone on the market.,"Absolutely incredible phone. This really seems like the greatest upgrade Apple has ever done on an iPhone compared to its predecessor.

The battery is superb, speed unreal, and the overall quality and performance is unmatched. Well done, Apple, well done.",5,1/2/20 23:34

I love the cameras, they take excellent pictures.",5,1/10/20 19:19
2148,Camera and face ID -- absolutely grand!,"It's your top of the line iPhone mostly carried forward from the past. The great advances over the X(10) which we kept in the family are the camera upgrade and face ID. Camera lives up to the hype: much better opticals along with more photo and video picture taking options, plus more editing options. Face ID is amazing. Reads your face at almost any angle.",5,12/21/19 10:02
2149,Decent Upgrade,"I wasn’t looking to upgrade but family member wanted to buy my Xs Max from me so sold it and bought the 11 Pro Max.  Biggest improvement for me is the battery.  I’ve used it for the last two days without a charge and I still have 56%.  The screen is also a decent improvement with better whites, blacks and brightness.  As for the camera, I guess if you take a lot of pictures then it’s worth an upgrade but if your like me who uses it more for work...I wouldn’t upgrade.  The three lenses on the back make it look weird and prefers the previous two lenses.",4,1/3/20 15:52
2150,"Smart, Handy, and Fun to use.","Upgrading from the iPhone 8 plus to the iPhone 11 Pro Max was a no brainer. I enjoy the convenience of unlocking the screen with Facial recognition.

2178,I love it,"I have been an iPhone user for years and will always be.  Super fast, and the battery life is amazing.",5,1/10/20 20:46
2179,BB Customer Service was great about screen issue!,"I'm a huge fan of Apple products, and a long-time owner of a succession of iPhones.  A lot more expensive than other brands, but the quality has always been worth it.  The durability has allowed me to ""live life"" without worrying about breakage resulting from normal, everyday use.  

I'm always very mindful of how I handle my electronics, and NEVER careless; vigilant but not paranoid.  Do I toss it in my pocketbook?  Of course!  Do I put it in the back pocket of my jeans once in a while?  Who doesn't?   

With no change in my day-to-day use, in 4 days, the screen of this ""11"" had a couple of fractures!  It was not dropped, and nothing hit it; nor did anything scratch or gouge it.  I immediately went back to BB to discuss the issue, and it was resolved with an exchange and the recommendation of a tempered glass screen protector.  I did get the screen protector for the replacement iPhone, and it's a good thing I did...  I’ve already had to replace that, yesterday, for the same problem:  unexplained fracture.  (This time the iPhone screen ""survived."")

Apparently this model is the first one that can't be popped in my back pocket for a few minutes to free up my hands.  I believe it's a design flaw and I'll be watching to see if this is noted as a common occurrence.  While I love everything else about it, this would be one concern in ""recommending"" it.  

Best Buy, regarding the required yes/no answer regarding recommendation, there should be a third option: ""unsure.""",3,10/10/19 07:41

I have the 256 GB  and I don’t think I will ever run out of room. There is so many features on this phone if I keep it for 10 years I will probably find something new.

2219,Impressive!!!,"I recently upgraded from the iPhone 7 Plus to the iPhone 11 Pro Max and I couldn’t be happier with my purchase. I was really excited to test out the new camera and it doesn’t disappoint. From how it shoots in low light areas to the 3 different lens types. I’m still getting a feel for the phone overall, but so far so good. My only gripe so far would be the lack of colors the phone actually comes in.",5,1/4/20 21:32
2220,Up grade,"I had to upgrade from my 6splus. The charging port finally broke... the lint in the port just ruined it. This phone is exact size to my previous phone. It does take a bit of getting use to; no home button, screen shots are the volume and lock button, ect. A nice upgrade! The camera is AWESOME and the biometrics are better the the finger print.",5,1/17/20 17:08
2221,Great IPhone favorite so far,"My last IPhone was a 7 plus(my previous favorite) this phone has great camera, no major improvements with SIRI, it’s extremely fast especially with the facial recognition. At first I missed the home button, but after using raise to wake and facial recognition, no problem. The battery life is the best feature, I’m using it for work and personal, (2) separate emails, Twitter, Instagram and Safari use as well as location services on. After 1st complete charge, 16 hours, and wasn’t dead!!!",5,12/6/19 15:35
2222,Good Phone,The only problem I  had with this phone is the visual voicemail and wifi calling didn't work.  I exchanged it for another one and everything works fine,4,10/18/19 15:14
2223,Nice phone with great features,"This phone is an upgrade from the 6s, so there are some major improvements and enhancements. Really like the camera, facial recognition and the fact that I can take advantage of the latest iOS release. Bought a protective case and screen protector so am enjoying the upgraded phone with features.
We did have to upgrade several apps and the iOS after purchasing the phone, but only experienced some minor problems with that.",5,12/14/19 18:54
2224,Awesome!,"An iPhone 8+ was my first ever iPhone, and upgrading to this seemed daunting. I love it, though, and I feel I am able to get every penny's worth out of it. The quality of this device is incredible abd the camera is totally worth it. The staff was happy to help me set it up. I would recommend this to anyone!",5,1/15/20 17:09
2225,Love this phone,"It takes a lot to get used to not having a home button and I am still working on getting the swipes down but I love the phone and the cameras.

First time I had a phone newer than my grands so I am learning it all on my own.",5,12/28/19 17:09
2226,Love my iPhone 11 ProMax,"Yes, they are pricey but you get what you pay for.  The screen is huge.  I'm a senior and that alone makes it excellent for me.  I traded in an iPhone 7 Plus for this phone and that screen was big but now that the viewing screen expands the width of the phone really makes a huge difference.  I haven't had time to learn all of the features yet, but so far everything is great.  Apple has not disappointed me with any of their phones and this phone is no exception.  LOVE APPLE, BEST BUY AND THEIR STAFF!!!",5,11/16/19 12:47
2227,iPhone 11 pro,"The only complaint I have about this amazing piece of technology is it is heavy. I’m just not use to the size difference from my old iphone 6s to this massive device. It is hard to hold for long period of time, if you like watching Netflix or other shows on your phone... invest in a stand.",5,1/18/20 13:50
2228,What a beautiful phone,"Has a large bright, crisp display and lots of features. Particularly love the Hey Siri feature to send messages, make phone calls, go to apps, etc. You do need to get some type of cover for it ( I did order one) as the uncovered phone is thin and lightweight and somewhat slick to hold onto - I'd hate to drop this beauty.",5,1/2/20 10:58
2229,I'm impressed,"Just switched from the Galaxy family. Never used an iPhone before and it is very easy now that you can use the SWIPE keyboard. My only 2 complaints are that it is not 5G and it is very expensive, but I knew that before I ought it.",5,1/24/20 15:31
2230,Great Camera!!!,The night photo option is amazing! It comes out ridiculously Clear!!,4,11/15/19 17:08
2231,Best of the Best,As always the iPhone's are overpriced but Pro max is the right size screen for my aging eyes. Screen resolution is phenomenal and this year's bionic chip is blazing fast. Did I mention battery life? The best ever on an iPhone and for me the most important feature. STRONGLY RECOMMEND if your wallet can afford it or you get it on sale.,5,12/15/19 06:16
2232,Amazing camera quality!,I had the 10 XS Max previously. They are both extremely similar. The only difference is the camera quality. The iPhone 10's camera quality is still amazing but there is just a very very very small difference.,5,1/24/20 16:25
2233,Great new features,I love the new features. The camera is amazing and I have adjusted quickly. It took some time to get used to not having the thumb button but the facial IF is much easier to use when accessing my phone.,5,1/25/20 14:25
2234,Switched to iPhone 11 Pro Max from Old Samsung,"I'm extremely happy with my new iPhone, although I am certainly still learning to use all its features.  I highly recommend this particular model; I am a senior citizen and appreciate the ease of use and especially the size of the screen.  Highly recommend!",5,1/3/20 18:41
2235,Great camera but still an iphone,"Camera is awesome but any new updates that you download , as usual,  slows your phone down upgrade after upgrade. $1400 to last possibly two years.",3,1/11/20 18:27
2236,LOVE,"As a long time iPhone user, this is a great evolution from previous generations. 

If you go for the Max, keep in mind that it is pretty big. If you have small hands it may be hard to hold. The camera though is truly incredible. 

Def recommend!",5,1/3/20 16:30
2237,Great Phone,I am really happy i popped for this phone over the iPhone 11 or iPhone 11 Pro. The phone's size is just right for me and makes everything easy to read. Still pictures and videos are outstanding - the improved stabilization on this phone is outstanding.,5,12/28/19 10:47
2238,11 pro max,So far I’m loving the cameras ! They pick up all the true colors and I am blown away by the quality.. the phone itself took a little bit of getting used to since I was coming from an iPhone 7plus..,5,1/10/20 19:55
2239,The price is completely worth it!,I really like the interface in this phone. They made it so easy to use with many shortcuts that really improve the consumer experience. The camera is great for people that care about the quality but not enough to buy a professional camera.,5,12/20/19 15:18
2240,Simply the best iPhone to date.,"It is fast, great battery life, super sharp screen with very realistic color rendition. Best phone camera I’ve ever used.  What else can you say.  This replaced my 5 yr old iPhone 6.",5,1/12/20 17:53
2241,Perfect Apple,"Nothing negative about this. Not a HUGE difference in daily use is noticed from the Xs Max. If you’re looking to upgrade you’ll be satisfied. 
Battery lasts for the majority of the day with normal use. I haven’t noticed a big difference in the Camera.",5,12/9/19 15:31
2242,Love this iPhone!!!,Loving the new iPhone 11 Pro Max! The camera is amazing and it has been very easy to learn the new features on it even without a home key.,5,1/28/20 13:09
2243,Amazing camera,I bought this for my wife’s Christmas.  She loves it.  The camera is amazing especially when taking low light pictures as compared to the 6 S Plus that this phone replaced.,5,1/3/20 20:07
2244,New Iphone 11 Pro Max is great,Bought it for my spouse as a gift. She is thrilled with it. Phone works great of course. The camera capability is quite awesome. Will take some time to get used to using this device. Very pleased.,5,12/21/19 20:15
2245,Love my new phone!,The camera on this phone is awesome! Love that it is water resistant as well! Still learning some of the new features but so far so good!,5,1/17/20 20:37

2250,"Very good camera, same size footprint of iPhone 7+",I wasn’t expecting to be already happy to have upgraded but I am pleasantly surprised. The one drawback I can say is the new swiping motion compared to pre iPhone X.,5,12/27/19 15:30
2251,Great phone! Fast and easy to use.,My first Iphone! I thought the Samsung S10 + was the best ever. I purchased this phone for a specific app developed to work blu-tooth with new hearing aids. The app is great and the phone is amazing.,5,12/6/19 17:22
2252,Enjoy every aspect of this phone.,I splurged and purchased the top of the line iPhone. Traded in my 6s. I enjoy the Face ID; is so much more simple and quick. Battery life is outstanding.,5,12/28/19 09:14
2253,Great phone,"I have owned several iphones over the years and swear by Apple products!  The camera on this model is so good you won't want to take selfies, it picks up every single pore on your face LOL",5,12/8/19 21:36

2257,Great Phone,I have been an apple fan for years so I might be partial. But I think this is a good upgrade the camera works good. The phone is easy to figure out.,5,12/27/19 16:43
2258,Camera upgrade,"Not much different beside the camera from my XS max it’s heavier which is a minus. If you’re upgrading from an 8 or lower this will be an awesome phone, if not it’s just the battery and camera that’s different. But I will say the camera is pretty phenomenal and the battery lasts a while, which is why I gave 4 stars!",4,12/27/19 15:52
2259,Very Nice Phone!,I bought this for my wife moving her from an iPhone 7 Plus.  Photos are amazing and the fidelity of her voice when we talk is like she is in the room with me!  Great phone!,5,12/14/19 14:06
2260,iPhone promax,"It is an iPhone.  You either love it or not.  Great camera.  Ran out of the one with 256 memory, so I got the one with 512 memory.",5,1/4/20 06:40
2261,Camera is worth the upgrade,If you have the XS max and are good with the camera keep it and wait for the 12 outside of the camera no big noticeable difference,5,1/3/20 18:37

2264,Great device,Amazing camera luv the new features and still have to get used to the swipe up feature,5,1/24/20 19:14
2265,Great camera on this phone,I’m still learning all the features after having traded in my iPhone 6S Plus. It takes a little getting used to not having a home button. It’s all about the swiping. The clarity on the iPhone 11 Pro Max is amazing.,5,11/12/19 20:40
2266,Easy to use,Love it.  Don’t know why I waited so long to get rid of the button. The 11Pro Max is so much easier to use and the cameras are great!,5,12/27/19 17:08
2267,Perfect,Superb phone with amazing camera capabilities. No low points in my opinion.,5,1/28/20 15:54
2268,Awesome Phone,"Nice larger view, Great camera and opens up much easier with the facial recognition vs finger print. Highly recommend.",5,1/3/20 17:04
2269,Great camera for beginners,"Nothing like being able to take awesome pictures to have for a lifetime, and have with you always because it’s taken on your phone. Love this phone, would recommended to anyone. Very easy to use",5,11/19/19 11:13
2270,Nice wide angle camera,"Better camera than the X. Now I don’t ever have a need for my old camera, unless I need to really zoom in from distance.",5,12/30/19 15:12
2271,iPhone 11 Pro Max.,Nice big screen with an efficient camera setup. iPhone works similar to other owned iPhones. Biggest difference is the screen size.,5,12/23/19 21:59
2272,iPhone 11 Pro Max.,The iPhone 11 Pro Max works very well. Functions like other iPhones. Biggest difference is screen size. Camera is really nice too.,5,12/23/19 22:00
2273,Love my iphone,I have had a iPhone since the iPhone 4. I love them and my entire family has one. The camera on the 11 Pro Max is fabulous.   Enjoy taking photos.,5,12/13/19 22:36
2274,Camera on phone,Best camera easy to use better than your own eyes. Worth the money,5,1/28/20 07:09
2275,Bring back the thumbprint scanner,"I traded in an 8Plus for the 11 Pro Max. Functionally, there is very little difference between the two. The camera on the 11 is definitely better (but the 8Plus was really good anyway), the battery lasts longer and the fast charger is good.  Speedwise it a little slicker but not by much. My gripe with this phone is the facial recognition. It is inconvenient and aggravating. You really have to get the right angle to be recognized, and if you pick up your phone a lot, having to swipe and hold the phone to your face only to have to type in the passcode or reswipe again, becomes aggravating and wears on you. Also, if you wear sunglasses, you need to remove them for it to work.  Extremely inconvenient. The thumbprint scanner was solid and almost never failed.  This is a great phone in almost all respects, but the inconsistent facial recognition performance is enough to knock not just one but two stars off for me.  In hindsight, I wish I had kept my 8Plus and waited for something better down the road. Save your money and wait for something better.",3,11/19/19 08:36
2276,Great camera love facial recognition,"I was reluctant to buy a new phone because of the hassle of 
data transfer.  It was a snap to mirror my old phone to the new
Apple pro 11 max in minutes. This is a NICE phone!!",5,11/23/19 13:43
2277,Loving it!,Like the large screen as I have eyesight problems. It allows easier reading of the screen and so I can increase the font and read books,5,12/15/19 23:03
2278,Son approved.,My son loves this phone. The photos are amazing.  Would recommend,5,1/26/20 17:12
2279,Lots of features to enjoy!,"Great product! Easy to transfer information.  Lots of new features to explore, especially the camera.",5,1/3/20 16:06
2280,Happy with the upgrade,Swiping instead of using the home button took me some getting used to but love it now and like the expanded view. Photos look great.,5,12/15/19 14:01
2281,Love all the features!!,"Love my new iPhone 11, the cameras are simply awesome along with the video editing app. Thumbs up!!!",5,1/3/20 18:48

2381,Apple you disappoint me every-tim i want to switch,"i don't want to complain much but i am disappointed with apple iphone , they have not changed anything since i had my last iPhone . The most annoying feature is when u cannot receive text messages when u are driving or receiving calls, yes it is something u can fix through the app but this is just plain stupid - too many restrictions camera is ok . For a basic iphone 64gb i trade it in to a Samsung galaxy note 10plus u can multitask and comes with 256gb memory 12gb of ram it completely destroys iphone in terms of specs 4gb or ram and 64gm memory - Come on apple wake up and restructure your business. Perfect example it took me 45 minutes to transfer data from galaxy note 9 to iphone and 2 min to transfer data from iPhone to Samsung galaxy note 10 plus. For business i would def use Samsung hands down.",2,1/17/20 15:22

2397,Windows Phone Was SOO Much Better,"I've been using Windows Phone for years.  Finally made the change to iPhone.  It feels like I've gone back in time by 5 years!  My phone is no longer a ""smart"" phone, it is an aggravating dumb phone!  iOS is awful at allowing me to use my phone the way I want!  Tried getting custom ringtones, and that was a grueling ordeal.  Tried downloading files to the phone and it was a nightmare.  Calendar doesn't work as well as Windows Phone, Contacts on iPhone are a nightmare mess of a disaster with no rhyme or reason to the photo associated with them. My wife told me to stop thinking logically and just feel good about my phone.  That's the Apple experience in a nutshell.

The phone itself is nice hardware, but my screen cracked after 3 days while the phone was in my pocket!  Not my back pocket, in my front pocket!  Forbes wrote an article about this problem with the iPhone 11 models.  I tried taking it back for exchange but Best Buy refused to take it. They said I had to buy Apple Care for $200 then pay another $30 to have the screen fixed.  On a $1,200 phone that is less than a week old.

The battery life is incredible on this phone.  Lasts 4 days between charging.  Charging takes about 1-2 hours.

iOS is almost catching up to Windows (5 years late).  It finally has a built in swipe keyboard, and it finally has dark mode.  But most things I try to do with iOS are more like I'm fighting and battling my phone rather than the phone helping me.  Don't even bother trying to get all your photos to display in the photos app... I have to go to each separate app like OneDrive or iCloud to see photos in each location.  Windows Phone was so much better in almost every way... I can't comprehend why people settled for this inferior clunky pain in the neck OS on their phones.",1,12/27/19 10:36

2400,Great camera.,Great phone. A few issues with Bluetooth and GPS connectivity.,4,11/1/19 18:25
2401,Camera is very blurry!,The camera is definitely a downgrade from the iPhone XS Max! The Apple Music seems to not work at certain times and the phone struggles to connect to the wifi,1,12/20/19 15:15
2402,Worst IPHONE EVER!!!!!!,"The IPHONE 11 Pro Max is the worst phone I have ever had.
I have had IPhones for 20 years and this is the worst.  Cant get calls and make calls.  Drops calls all the time.  I have spent two (2) afternoons at Apple store and still have a terrible problem.  Phone doesnt even show that people have called. ( no missed calls) 
APPLE NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING AS I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS THIS PROBLEM.",1,11/21/19 19:17
