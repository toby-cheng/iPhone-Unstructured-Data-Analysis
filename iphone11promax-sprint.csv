"1","great phone","Great phone as expected for the latest iPhone , got it for the wife and she has no complains about it.",5,2020-01-21 13:08:00
"2","Best iPhone yet","Simplicity meets need.
One rugged price of equipment.
Still has the same kinks like the face unlock doesn’t work when your driving Or at an angle and people will see u putting in your passcode If it doesn’t work.
These are easy fixes. It could use multi tasking otherwise the best speedy  and beautiful.
Too expensive .",4,2019-10-18 17:04:00
"3","This iphone takes great picturesIt takes time to g","It takes a little time to get use to this iPhone, because it no longer have the home button you have to swipe.",5,2019-10-22 07:07:00
"4","Fantastic camera","I love the pictures this phone takes. It met the mark on almost every level.",5,2019-10-18 15:30:00

"8","The phone keep crashing","The constantly crash so planning on return it before my 14 days expored to get another one",1,2019-10-05 07:29:00
"9","Great value dollar per dollar!!!","This new iPhone separated itself from the rest, is lighter, it feels right on the hand. The transition from a physical button to a digital operation is painless.
I will recommend this iPhone to anyone with an iphone 8 and below. Newer phones are very similar but I will still say the iphone 11 pro is a better phone.",5,2019-10-11 23:33:00
"10","Great Phone that scratches easily","I love the phone, especially the camera. After upgrading from a 7 Plus, I got used to the new gestures and lack of home button very quickly. The only negative I have is that, after having several iPhones and never using a screen protector, after less than 2 weeks, my screen has a scratch deep enough for me to feel with my fingernail. I have no idea how it happened because I've treated it the same as all other non-scratched phones. It's bothering me to see so I guess I'll have to put a screen protector on it. Maybe it'll hide the scratch. There is a discussion about it on the Apple page as well. I recommend the phone, just go ahead and put a screen protector on it from the start.",5,2019-10-25 21:44:00
"11","Awesome phone.","It’s been seven days with it and can say that it is a great iPhone 
I come from an iPhone XR that i had for barely 4months, it’s crazy!
Prior to that i had an iPhone 6 for 5 years and an iPhone 4s for 4 years, so am not exactly a compulsive iPhone buyer hehe, The only reason that I switch my XR for the 11 Pro was the camera AND because i had the chance to get a good deal on it, but the iOS its great too. i was one of the lucky ones that didn’t get pesky bugs with it. I don’t know how to really describe it all i can tell that so far this is an awesome phone. The pictures it takes look professional, videos and games vey crisp, of course everything else is good too, calls, Bluetooth connectivity with my devices is great no drops, Siri is more intelligent now.so much that am actually using it. Am just a happy iPhone owner the kind of happiness that only iPhone owners know, if you have a chance to upgrade don’t hesitate, you wont regret it.",5,2019-09-27 18:08:00
"12","Great for people who love taking photos!","I know this is said every year but this is truly the best iPhone camera Apple has ever made! In addition to that, the battery is incredible. I can go a whole day without needing to worry about charging it. If you’re fan of gaming on the go, the new selection of games on Apple Arcade look absolutely beautiful on this giant screen. With the new processor, some of these games can almost stand up with console games in terms of graphics and quality. And lastly, the phone itself is absolutely beautiful to look at and hold. The three cameras took some getting used to at first but now they look great imo.",5,2019-10-19 11:55:00
"13","Amazing camera!","Decided to upgrade from iPhone X. Amazing quality only Apple provides. Longer battery life, unbelievably fast, and pictures are amazing! Previous iPhone cameras were not good in low light or in settings with bright sun in background. Pro max delivers amazing photos and videos in all lighting. Wife initially upgraded to the Note10+, but changed to a Pro Max for the overall functionality and camera.",5,2019-10-05 03:37:00
"14","The bomb battery  liiiife","I’m enjoying my upgrade I had the XS and I must say the battery life on this phone is the best one to date! The new square and battery upgrade was needed! I enjoy the cameras yes they’re lovely being that I’m a selfie gal but the battery is where it’s at period for me!!! I left it off the charger for a entire day and tada my phone didn’t die out! I’m a heavy user but during this time I kept it basic normal lighting, texting was over the top and I’d say social media 6 hours  off and on. My battery went down to 10%. I’m impressed!",5,2019-10-18 16:12:00
"15","Best ever!!!","I have been hard using Apple devices for the last 12 years, and I own almost all top devices under Apple brand and I have to say you that I have a big problem....

All my devices bought on the last 10 years are still working and I can’t imagine bring them to recycling, so I believe that I’m a few years I will have a persona museum to show to the new generations of my relatives part of the tech history!!!

Everything always can be better, and I’m sure that Apple devices are on the way to become day by day a little better ever!!!",5,2019-10-18 20:09:00
"16","If you’re military never deal with Best Buy","If you’re looking for a military discount for your account do not go through Best Buy. They don’t have any idea of what the bill should actually be and don’t work for the carriers directly and will have absolutely zero answers when there is an issue. the phone is great but don’t do it....",5,2019-12-27 15:29:00
"17","Excellent","My iPhone XSMax is one of my favorite and best phones. I think I have had every model of the iPhone except the 8.  The iPh 11 ProMax improves on the older model quite a lot. They look identical except for the camera, but it really is a big improvement in battery life, screen, picture quality and function. Quality feel and look is excellent.   I do hope it is not plagued with battery issues as so many modern day iPhones tend to have.   Its expensive !",5,2019-10-02 00:46:00
"18","Great!","As always the iPhone 11 Pro Max is easy to use. Camera is great too! I am happy to say that Apple didn't disappoint with the new upgrades.",5,2020-02-05 13:59:00
"19","It’s a nice size. Good product","Very intuitive just like the other Apple productsGood product. It’s easy to see easy to read I have a small hand it’s not too big or too or falling out of my hand I do have a silicone case so in case it does fall it won’t break. It is a little of a chore getting used to it because it doesn’t have the home button like my seven did but I’m sure that will just come a time",5,2019-10-17 16:46:00
"20","Too much phone for a 17 year old","I bought this for my daughters birthday. She is 17 and the Iphone 11 probably would have been good enough. It is huge but a very nice phone. She bought the silver one and the color is almost white in color. It is a great phone, just like the last one",5,2019-10-05 08:37:00
"21","IPhone 11 Pro Max","Everything from the display, to the size of the screen, the design of the phone is absolutely great! I would highly recommend this phone to any and everyone . If you dont mind spending the extra money definitely purchase this phone.",5,2019-12-14 20:27:00
"22","Great phone","Needed a upgrade from my 8 plus ! So far so good great phone. Still getting used to different features. 
Can’t complain! Definitely like the bigger screen!",5,2020-01-18 11:23:00
"23","Awesome!!","I had the original iPhone And then was strictly Samsung....I traded in my galaxy 10 plus for the 11 Pro max and don’t regret it in the slightest... this phone is a beast",5,2020-01-10 15:23:00
"24","All around great except reception","I’ve been part of the Apple Ecosystem for going on 10 years now and the iPhone 11 series is by far the best offering yet. Camera is a huge upgrade, which I didn’t think was possible, and the battery seems to last forever. Plus it’s super fast and the screen looks great. Only issue I’m having is slightly less reception than I did on my Xs Max.",5,2019-10-19 05:24:00
"25","Great phone... not much difference from XS Max","I upgraded from the XS Max to the 11 Pro Max because I’m on the iPhone forever plan so I figured as the phone will depreciate faster than the value will hold... and because I could upgrade for a minimal upgrade fee I might as well get the latest and greatest. Works great. Camera and battery are noticeably better although!",5,2019-10-23 22:46:00
"26","Phone is amazing!","This iPhone is by far the best one I’ve had yet! I absolutely love the picture and sound quality. The pictures this phone takes is absolutely amazing and makes me feel like a wannabe photographer. My one massive flaw I have with this phone is that it’s on the sprint network. Everything else on this phone is perfect except for the carrier.",5,2019-10-11 15:52:00
"27","iPhone 11 Pro Max is the Gold Standard","I upgraded to this model from an iPhone X.  Both are great cell phones and I really cannot find many useful differences in the phone function.  The camera on the 11 Pro Max is an upgrade that I have not had the phone long enough to explore, but so far the pictures are excellent.",5,2019-11-04 15:54:00
"28","Impressive","This is a snappy phone- coming from Android has been interesting, but it looks promising with its speed and overall smoothness. I have had the occasional crash however. I hope those are few and far between.",5,2019-12-07 21:31:00
"29","About time they up the camera game","I had the iPhone 7plus since it came out waited a long time for a decent upgrade very happy with the phone I would recommend it highly",5,2019-09-29 16:00:00
"30","Enjoy the bigger phone","I upgraded to the iPhone 11 Pro Max from an iPhone X .  I enjoy the bigger screen, but it is a little uncomfortable when it is in my pocket.  Other than that, I love the phone and am glad we upgraded when we did.",5,2019-12-04 09:29:00
"31","Great phone","I went from having a iPhone 8 to this phone and I love it! I thought that I was going to have some difficulty with not having the home button but I am now used to it",5,2019-12-27 16:18:00
"32","iPhone 11 pro max nice little phone","I very much like the 11 pro max over the ax’s max which was not a very friendly iPhone for me. So far the 11 pro Max has met expectations even though it has only been in my possession a couple of weeks. I expect to probably keep this model for a couple of years until the 5G models arrive in a couple of years.",5,2019-10-11 16:17:00
"33","Amazing camera and battery","This phone wasn’t a huge upgrade from my X but I’m glad I did it the battery is the longest I’ve had in a phone as far as I can tell, and the camera quality is amazing as always, it’s a little heavier probably because it’s sturdier I would definitely recommend it",5,2019-11-03 11:37:00
"34","iPhone 11 Pro Max awesome upgrade","I love the ease of online ordering my new iPhone 11 pro max silver avoiding lines at the store. Quick pickup once I reached the store. Apple products always packaged well and bestbuy threw in a new SIM card.",5,2019-09-25 16:50:00
"35","Love the phone, hate the hassle of setting up","This is the first phone that I have had to set up myself, rather than a technician do it. It took 4+ hours to get it working between  figuring out the SIMS card and how to open the compartment (had to use a youtube video) and getting it activated on Sprint (3 calls and nearly 3 and 1/2 hours). The phone now works great and looks amazing.",5,2019-09-23 12:00:00
"36","iPhone Green","I really like the new iPhone. I recently got the new iPhone in Green and the color is really cool and different. I like the new camera feature that seems to take better pictures than my old 7plus. So I would go with the new iPhone in Green if I had to make the choice all over again.",5,2019-10-19 07:50:00
"37","IPhone 11 Pro Max","I loved my IPhone 7 Plus. So when deciding on a new phone, it was a easy choice going with the IPhone 11 Pro Max! Still getting use to some new features but so far, so good!",5,2019-12-13 16:31:00
"38","Great Phone","Upgraded from an iPhone 6 (since no more iOS updates).  The difference is obviously huge. This phone should last me another 5 to 6 generations since Sprint will take forever on 5G rollout.",5,2019-09-27 15:20:00
"39","Amazing camera and features","Previously had iPhone X so this was an upgrade...overall great phone",5,2020-01-31 15:11:00

"44","Great Camera, Great Phone","The iPhone 11 Pro Max is an amazing phone. It has a great battery life, awesome cameras, and an outstanding display. Although, if you already own a X (pronounced Ten) or a XS/XS Max, I wouldn’t recommend upgrading yet unless it’s in your contract to do so.",5,2019-10-19 09:12:00
"45","Great Phone","Had to get this for the wife, since I was upgrading mine. She went from an iPhone 8 so not as big a leap as my iPhone 6 upgrade. Wife still likes this more than her old phone.",5,2019-09-27 15:25:00

"53","Loving this phone","I waited a while to do the review because I usually change my mind after a few months, but I’m still in love with this phone. I updgraded from an iPhone X & it’s definitely a difference in the picture quality.",4,2020-01-18 15:06:00

"62","Unimpressed","I have had this phone just over a month. Many many functions but not sure if necessary. I am not a big fan of the new touch style screen. Takes time to get used to it and allows usage problems depending on the individuals touch. Screens lock up during texting , email and while sending photos. I had to shut it down numerous times to free up the frozen screen. Camera is quite complicated and tricky to use. I think I liked my IPhone 8 Plus better but time will tell.",3,2020-01-31 22:09:00

"67","Best iPhone ever","This phone has some awesome upgrades. The camera is phenomenal. Speed is unbeatable. Picture clarity is awesome. I’ve gone over a day in a half without charging the phone.

The only thing I don't like is with android you were able to create groups for texting and emailing, etc. I have not been able to do that with this phone and was told it couldn't be done on IOS.

They’re supposed to be an extended five hour battery life but I’m not getting it. I put it on energy saver and by 4 o’clock I am at 30%. The same with my 10. To me, it wasn’t worth the upgrade and when I went to exchange the phone, Best Buy wouldn’t allow me to exchange it because I had pre-ordered it. The customer service was horrible. I told him that I was having issues with the battery.",3,2019-09-27 15:55:00

"283","The best iPhone ever","I’ve had the iPhone 11 Pro Max for a little over a month now. I can say that this is hands down the best iPhone ever. It is very expensive yes, and it does what most other iPhones can do but this phone does it all so quick and smoothly. Every app loads up quick, and the battery life is outstanding. I take my phone off the charger at about 1pm and head out at 3pm. By the time I get home at around 1am I still have 50 to 60% battery life left. I use my phone quite a bit throughout the day to play Pokémon go lol and watch YouTube / browse the web and social media. 
The camera is also remarkable, especially when shooting video. It takes the best video I’ve seen on a smartphone, I always shoot at 4K 60fps and it’s crisp and pretty. Especially in low light / concerts. The screen on this iPhone is very bright and colors pop nicely. It’s my favorite smartphone ever. I know this phone is very expensive, but If you’re a “power user” and want a great camera on your phone, then I think it’s worth the money. Skip the base model and get at least 256gb though. You’ll quickly eat up storage if you take a lot of video.",5,2019-11-26 22:35:00
"284","Not much different","I bought phone and honestly not much different than X max pro  I actually enjoyed that phone more some features were removed on the new model ie the 3D Touch",3,2019-11-08 16:13:00

"290","Phone is great but not sprint","When i took the phone they said i need to pay 25 dollars/mon. But later when i saw my bill its  alot greater than i expected. When i reached the customer service agents every individual is giving me different opinions. One said they can reduce the bill and one say it is the least price. I am really confused by the sprint",1,2019-11-08 15:42:00
"291","Do not buy!","There is nothing exciting about this device. There was nothing much changed since iPhone 8 plus. Do not buy the product so apple gets the message that they need to do a better job. Just like it was during Steve Jobs. Epic fail!",1,2019-09-28 18:06:00

"298","I don’t think it’s quite worth it’s cost.","I don’t think it’s quite worth it’s cost.  It freezes up from time to time. Picture quality is great, however sometimes it won’t save the image it took or will capture a blurry one when camera was still during shot. 
Everything else is good, but same as a regular IPhone.",3,2020-01-19 18:35:00
"299","Excellent","Was a little hesitant about spending the extra money on the current version thinking I wasn't going to need the new features. Glad I did. The new camera is phenomenal.

"301","Upgrade if you can","This is definitely a difference between the 10 and the 7. The camera features on this phone is worth the upgrade. It’s like having a GoPro with phone capabilities. If you enjoy taking pictures with your phone this is the one to upgrade to. Apple jumped on fixing the small bugs that the original software had and the phone works great.",5,2019-10-27 19:46:00

"309","Great Phone","The Midnight Green in pictures look great, but in person, the color is not much different than the Space Grey. The phone is great though, this was for my gf who upgraded from the 7+ so she is really enjoying the new features. I would suggest that if you have an X or Xs then there is no real point in upgrading other than the new camera feature and specs that the normal users will never know the difference with the naked eye.",4,2019-10-18 16:32:00
