"1",1,"Great product for a first time Apple user","I've never owned an Apple product but this year I took the plunge to move from Android (Pixel phones, Samsung phones) to get this iPhone 11. It was the right time for me to do so. With the changes and improves iOS13 brings (from all that I've read and watched in reviews/vids) and the camera upgrades from XR; the transition has been fairly easy. I know there is a learning curve for me as I slowly learn the iOS system. But I changed to have the best of both worlds. And it is true the Google apps in iOS do run better than on Android.

The phone performance has been stellar. NO lag. NO freezes. I had prepared myself to have a smooth experience with iOS, but I have still been surprised and pleased with the fluidity. Never have I experienced anything so smooth on any of the many Android phones I've used over the years. The battery is a superstar champ. It feels as if I cannot kill it if I were to try. Even though I am never far from a charging option, it is so refreshing to not feel battery anxiety.

Siri is WAY better than I was led to believe. In fact I find her to be more responsive and less buggy than Google Assistant - especially when using Apple CarPlay. This was a surprise to me due to all I've read. Voice to text is admittedly not as accurate as Assistant. 

I already knew the iPhone cameras take the best videos, but the updates to the photos themselves are phenomenal. The auto night mode is fantastic - I like it better than Pixel's Night Sight. It seems more natural. True the Portraits are sometimes not as well defined as on the Pixel phones - but that is something that is not a game changer for me. I like the fact that photos on the iPhone 11 are not over sharpened as is true on the Pixel lineup (I've had all 3 Pixel phones so I'm not spinning my wheels here).

True tone is fantastic. The color (mint green) is the prettiest color I've had on a phone. I have no issues with the LCD screen versus OLED - it's a great screen. The gestures are great and smooth and easy to learn. 

I've been so pleased with this that I'm not looking at (researching) buying one of the Macbook laptops (tablets are not for me). 

This is a fantastic phone. No looking back.",5,2019-10-06 11:43:00
"2",2,"Very good phone and camera","High quality phone that still has about 50 % charge at the end of the day. Very good camera especially if you edit with Camera+.",5,2019-10-18 18:21:00
"3",3,"Bought 2","Wife needed one bought her and I one. Love low light camera function",5,2019-12-07 08:13:00
"4",4,"Love it","I’m already an iPhone user for many years. But really impressed with how much easier it is. Camera is much better. Longer battery life! Much more memory! Love it!!!",5,2020-01-18 17:46:00
"5",5,"Amazing pics and footage!","Love my new iPhone 11! It’s fast and the camera is amazing. Video quality is excellent.",5,2020-01-03 16:22:00
"6",6,"Great phone for the price","This review is based on upgrading from an iPhone X to an 11, hopefully it helps those who are in the same situation. 
There were a few reasons I chose to upgrade, I wanted a slightly bigger screen, I wanted better battery life, and I wanted better speed (I play quite a bit of games on my phone). I had also made the mistake of getting an X with only 64gb which was a bad idea to begin with. This phone fortunately covers all those issues. The battery life is great and the speed at which this phone opens apps is incredible. The camera with the wide angle is also a big bonus, I’ve never been a big photographer with my phones, but I’ve found myself using this phone a lot more for that purpose.
The one downside to this phone is the quality of the screen, this is more evident with the new dark mode in iOS13. Black screens on this phone aren’t really black, they’re more of a dark grey and this is due to the OLED vs LCD screen.
I still own my X and once I upgraded it to iOS13 I could see the difference in dark mode, on my X the black backgrounds seem truly black while on the 11 the blacks seem a little lighter. Does this make the upgrade not worth it? I guess it depends how much the lighter blacks bother you. Personally, after a month of use I don’t notice it much anymore.
At $749 for the 128gb I would highly recommend this phone, if the LCD screen bothers you that much then I would recommend going for the Pro but at the price point I’m not sure extra deep blacks are worth it.",5,2019-10-21 13:03:00
"7",7,"Fantastic upgrade","Upgraded to the 11, 128gb from an 8+ 256gb. Never needed 256 with the 8+ But that was the next size up from 64gb. 128gb is perfect. I’m able to keep all of my photos and all of my music on this phone with 60+gb left. A lot of talk about how the pro screen is so much better than the 11’s LCD screen. But going from the 8+ that already had an LCD, this screen seems sharper and more vibrant. The thing that really stands out is the speed. This thing just flies. I can click a link or open a new app and it loads almost as quickly as snapping your fingers. The camera on the 8+ was already pretty good, but again the 11 shines better here. I love the wide angle lense and the night mode. I used to hate taking low-light pics due to the flash making things seem so white. What I like most is gaining some screen size compared to my 8+, but in a smaller form factor. Overall I am extremely satisfied with my upgrade and would definitely do it again. For most people, the iPhone 11 is the upgrade that is worth every penny!",5,2019-09-22 16:19:00
"8",8,"A screen I can see without the bulk of a PLUS","I left a 7 for this 11. It gives me a visual screen that I can see without the bulk of the iPhone 7+ which my husband is very happy with. 

It’s taken a bit to get the hang of it but I had excellent help getting started with the help of Joshua in the mobile department. Later I went back in to my geek Michael who went step by step through the questions that had cropped up. 

If you haven’t used anything past iPhone 8 be sure to play around and make a list of what you’re stuck on. Take it to mobile or geek squad. If it’s easier, call Apple. 

Enjoy your new iPhone!!!

Very important to me is that this phone doesn’t have the OLED screen. I’m extremely light sensitive and get migraines. This is the only phone I can use. If Apple  switches to all OLED screens in the future I’m off iPhone.",5,2019-09-27 15:30:00
"9",9,"Amazing camera","The only thing that really sperates phones these days seems to be the cameras. I had a pixel 2 xl (now on galaxy s10e) which takes the best pictures. My wife bought the iPhone 11 and I am thinking about switching to it. The camera is AMAZING. Battery life is great and the new iOS adds a lot of shortcuts that apple was missing. For 699 apple hit a home run with this phone. Even tho the screen is lower resolution the colors and brightness are astounding. I'm not an Apple fan but may be...I just haven't switched yet because I still love Android but I'm on the fence.",5,2019-10-13 09:22:00
"10",10,"Best iPhone to this day! Right size right price.","The iPhone 11 is an amazing phone. I had a XS Max before, and traded it in to get this, and I am so happy I did. This is what I consider the “Goldilocks” iPhone; it’s just right. The size, both screen and body, is perfect, being in between the 11 Pro and Pro Max. It’s not as good a screen as the Pro’s OLED, but it’s still pretty darn good. The colors are amazing and it still is a very high-definition screen. Why spend extra for a better screen? You’re getting the same processor, which is wicked fast, and ALL the same features as the Pro! I am so glad that I switched from the XS Max because I can enjoy all of the same great features of the Pro model for a fraction of the cost. I would HIGHLY recommend considering buying the 11 over the Pro series.",4,2019-09-29 17:16:00
"11",11,"Love it! It’s easy to use. Nice!","Not a big stretch from my previous iPhone as far as understanding how to use the functionality. I’m happy with this phone. Thanks WBHauser",5,2020-01-17 19:22:00
"12",12,"I phones  keep getting better","Started off with a iPhone 4 then thru the years kept upgrading up to the new iPhone 11.  I really must say the iphone 11 knock it out of the park!  Very user friendly and easily adaptable even for the beginner. Battery life is alot better then my previous phones. Thank you iPhone and Bestbuy.",5,2019-10-13 10:41:00
"13",13,"This was a pre order","I’m sure this is a great phone but I cancelled it the very next day when I discovered the 128gb was only $50 more. I could easily have stayed with the 64gb since I only used 32gb of my 128gb iPhone 7. It’s just that I got used to the security of having plenty of space. 

I ordered the red (instead of the purple that I really like) because 100% goes to fighting Aids. I will always choose a product that supports a charity.",5,2019-09-20 16:48:00
"14",14,"my first iphone","this  is my first iphone, been a samsung owner since the S4 came out, it's a great phone, love how it picks up wifi where ever i am, no signing in to networks. i got the 11 because i'm a photographer, it's all about the camera for me. my 2 issues is the volume, on phone calls i have to put on speaker phone,just to see if i'm connecting with my caller, i'm still learning how to navigate thru out, also the photos are out of order when transferred over, but pairs well with my car.  pros and cons like everything.",5,2020-01-26 11:02:00
"15",15,"Amazed","I have had the 8 plus in red for 2 years but I was the  lucky One and got a defective device it didn’t happen after the first year was over and I was debating on the 11 or 11 pro and after finally deciding on the 11 I don’t see much of a difference except a little more screen and extra camera but I love my red iPhone 11 best decision and of course Best Buy is the way to go when starting a contract or upgrading they always look for deals and with a lower phone payment",5,2019-12-06 15:35:00
"16",16,"Good Phone","I was impressed by how well the content transferred from my old Iphone to the new one, it even captured my folders on the screen and the open internet windows I had.  I stayed onsite at Best Buy and they helped me get things going.  They also price matched a phone case for me which saved me time and energy ordering it from elsewhere. 

the only struggle I had was transferring my applewatch content to the new phone, my husband had to back it up on a desktop and reset some things before the apple watch would recognize the new phone.",5,2020-01-03 16:15:00
"17",17,"Terrific phone","I’m totally impressed with this new I-phone 11. I was a dedicated Blackberry owner for 20 years! Now I’m wondering what took me so long to switch. At 72 years old I have mastered iOS 13 in a little more than one day! It is so incredibly friendly. I love it.",5,2019-09-27 15:24:00
"18",18,"So many reasons this was a great gift","My son had issues with his old phone and the thought of not being able to get a hold of each other at any time was upsetting to both of us. His old phone likely could have been repaired, but there was no guarantee. It made sense to buy a new phone and know that he not only had something reliable, but also something that had better features and more storage than his previous phone. He loved it and I love knowing that he appreciates the new phone as well.",5,2020-01-18 14:44:00
"19",19,"Impressive New Version of the iPhone","I had been using an iPhone 6s for several years but was having issues with battery life, the charging port, etc. so I decided it was time to update. I debated buying an older model rather than the iPhone 11 to avoid the use of Face ID but decided to go with the most recent model and think that was the right decision. The battery life is fantastic in comparison to my old phone, the picture quality is great and I am enjoying the slightly larger screen. I have still not turned on Face ID but may do so eventually which reduces the ease of use somewhat in comparison to the old thumbprint ID.",4,2020-01-03 16:37:00
"20",20,"Great new phone","I’m still getting used to my new iPhone 11 because it’s quite a bit different from my iPhone 6S Plus. I loved that phone but am starting to love my new iPhone 11 as well. I really like the red color to start with, but also all the new features, such as face recognition, swiping from one screen to the next & the camera takes really clear & pretty photos. There are many other options that I’m still learning, but overall I really like my new phone & would highly recommend it.",5,2020-01-10 16:36:00
"21",21,"Nice upgrade!","I've had an Apple 6+ iPhone for years and finally decided to purchase an upgrade to iPhone 11.  It's a really nice phone and the new features are cool. I wish these phones weren't so expensive but the quality and security this phone provides helps offset the price for me. I also have a MacBook Pro, so I like that I have 2 Apple products that are easy to sync.",5,2020-02-07 16:20:00
"22",22,"Pretty big compared to iPhone 6","I upgraded from an iPhone 6 to this iPhone 11 which is much larger, does not have the ""button"" to push on the screen (now need to swipe right) and does not allow charging and use of headphones at the same time - both use the same port.  Definitely something to get used to.  Some of my App. passwords transferred over, some did not.  I'm still not sure what the difference is in having 2 cameras instead of one.  Learning curve.",5,2020-01-07 17:15:00
"23",23,"Best iPhone ever!","I moved up from an SE. What a difference!  Facial id makes sign on a breeze. You pick up the phone, look at it and boom you are in. Swoop up and there are your apps. Swoop up again to leave an app. 

Sound is good quality. I haven’t used the headphones so I can’t comment. 

This is the 64 gig model. The case is actually as large as the pro.",5,2020-02-01 00:42:00
"24",24,"Real Nice Upgrade!","Upgrading from a 6, this baby really is nice. Battery life is about twice as long, even after taking advantage of battery replacement on my old 6. Processing speed is astounding, app upgrades are super short. Display is large, bright and sharp. Size was more than I wanted, but it still fits in my front pocket. I thought the loss of the home button was going to be problematic, but in a few hours of use I was completely comfortable with swiping up. So much so that I get somewhat lost when I have to use my wife’s 7. The camera is much more capable than I need but I’m finding new uses as I discover features. The only downside is they didn’t give it to me for free!",5,2019-10-18 20:48:00
"25",25,"Switched from Android to IOS","I am new to an Apple IOS phone. There is a slight learning curve for a first time purchaser of an Apple product. I like the phone but, there are a few features I dislike. 1. I don't like that if I am away from my phone and receive a text message or phone call I have no way of knowing I have received either because, there isn't a light that will blink to let me know I have missed either. 2. I don't care for the camera to much. I don't see options to change my pictures such as, low lighting mode, panorama, and others I can't think of right now. 3. I don't like that I can not use some apps that I could on my android. 4. I don't like that I have to turn WiFi off each day from the top right corner pull down. Then it tells me it will turn it off until the next day and each day I have to go through that to turn it off.  If I go into settings and turn it off there, I am not able to use my hot spot. For it to be an Apple 11 (yes I know it's not the pro or pro max) you would think it would have more features. However, as I said I am new to Apple and it could just be that I have not figured things out.",4,2019-11-05 16:05:00
"26",26,"Impressive New Version of the iPhone","Bought this for my wife who had been using an iPhone 6s for several years but was having issues with battery life and fuzzy pictures so I decided it was time to update. I debated buying an older model for her rather than the iPhone 11 to avoid the use of Face ID but decided to go with the most recent model and think that was the right decision. The battery life is fantastic in comparison to her old phone, the picture quality is great and she is enjoying the slightly larger screen. She has been using Face ID but has not been thrilled with the functionality in comparison to the old thumbprint ID. She is also having to replace her phone holders due to the larger size.",4,2020-01-06 15:44:00
"27",27,"Flawless","Lightning fast processor. My emails, reports, PDFs, app updates, everything! downloads so quickly. There is nearly zero wait time for apps that I have had to wait between 30 seconds and 2 minutes for my XR that I traded in.

Camera: the HD features of the 11 are pretty much useless if your subject is farther than 8 feet away. Also, depending on the angle of capture, faces of people can appear slanted or warped if they are on the edge of the shot; I understand this is hard to escape, due to the tiny lens creating a “walleye vision” effect just from the light passing through it. Physics is still unarguable, despite our digital prowess.",5,2019-10-21 08:56:00
"28",28,"So far so good","I went from an Android to an IPhone this time around. I was hoping the battery life would be better but not so much. It is a work in progress getting used to the difference in operating systems. The camera is good not much difference my my old phone. Over all pretty good.",4,2019-09-28 06:36:00
"29",29,"Big upgrade from my wife's SE","All works well. Pro tip, take the plastic screen protector from the factory off before trying to call or you and the person you're talking to will be frustrated. All works well, iOS transfer is great for mirroring devices. Camera was actually less clear than expected. Shots seem very grainy and not high quality when sending to other devices with higher resolution screens.",5,2020-01-03 16:48:00
"30",30,"iPhone 11 is a great phone.","I was cautioned before buying it about it not having a ""home"" button. It took me all of two minutes to get used to using the phone without one.  I like everything about this phone.",5,2020-02-28 18:09:00
"31",31,"Second time was the charm","Got an iPhone 11 on Black Friday and for the first time ever in my Apple buying experience, the phone wouldn't work. It couldn't connect for some reason. After the great help at Best Buy, I was given this phone and it's been great ever since. Getting to know the new functions was pretty easy after having a 7 for so long. 

Great phone for a great cause.",5,2019-12-22 11:10:00
"32",32,"This is a very good phone.","My husband and I both bought one of these iPhone 11 phones. I thought this was a vast improvement over my iPhone 7. It seems to be a very easy to work with phone, now I just have to get used to IOS 13. I wish to commend both Terrell and Adrienne for the great jobs they did for us at the Verizon desk. I think they are a great asset for the Best Buy store in Mishawaka Indiana store.",5,2019-10-01 08:15:00
"33",33,"The sweet spot in the iPhone line up","I, like another reviewer, traded in an iPhone XS Max for the iPhone 11. No regrets! I like the size better, it has a brilliant screen, and saves me $15.00/month on my phone bill. I still have the features of the Pro series that matter to me and paying $400 less for it. All iPhones are great phones and I wouldn’t own anything else but for me the 11 hits all the marks for my needs at a reasonable price. If you’re on the fence about upgrading to the iPhone 11, go for it! You won’t regret it. It’s a great device!",5,2019-10-25 17:49:00
"34",34,"So far , so good.","Present for my son.  His old phone needed a serious upgrafe... so we went for it.  iphone 11.  He loves it! And going to Best Buy instead of going to our carrier... EXCELLENT!  Our Best Buy Rep was knowledgeable & honest... and it only took 20 minutes... seriously only 20 minutes.  We would have been at our carrier for 2 hours.  Ha!",5,2019-12-21 07:38:00
"35",35,"Unlocked and Best Buy is the way to go.","Bought a unlocked iPhone 11 from Best Buy.

Highly recommend Best Buy for all your wireless needs.",5,2020-01-04 10:40:00
"36",36,"Great batter life!","This is my first iPhone and I love it so far. The battery life is much better than my google pixel.

"37",37,"Much needed upgrade","The new iPhone 11 net every expectation and more for a holiday gift for my daughter.

"38",38,"So far so good.","I did purchase the XR and the camera was terrible!  I could not understand how a Pixel 2 could be it.  This double camera seems to be a lot better.  I took a video in 4k, but I cannot watch it in 4k on the phone, a little strange, but OK.  Battery life is FANTASTIC.  The screen is bright.  Having a hard time with the sounds, either too loud or cannot hear it. But I like the phone, like IOS 13 and like the dual speakers on the bottom.",5,2019-11-12 09:42:00
"39",39,"I switched to the dark side","I am not a fan of apple.  However all of my kids have iphones and I was missing out on the interconnectivity that iphones have.

This is a really nice phone and takes great pictures.",5,2019-12-29 00:19:00
"40",40,"Rough start but a great phone","I had some issues, probably from the IOS 13 bugs restoring this phone from a backup. It froze up, shut down and would not power on. After a visit to BB a tech got it back up running using vol up, vol down and power button combo unfroze the phone. After a couple of IOS 13 updates it works fine. Battery life is incredible! All day of sometime heavy use without a mid day boost. Love the wireless charging, but Apple should throw in a wireless charger rather than making us buy one separately.

"41",41,"Still getting used to it","This phone replaced an iPhone 5 that was 6 1/2 years old.  I loved that smaller phone, but the battery was just getting weird.  I would lose 80% of my charge in just five minutes.  This phone probably has way more features than I will ever use.  I'm still getting used to swiping it, instead of hitting a home key.  Sadly, it no longer fits into ""pockets"" in my Baggalini purse, so now it's just in the main compartment.  Therefore, I bought a screen protector because I think it's more vulnerable now.  I also wasn't used to the fact that it turns on automatically whenever you touch it.  I was worried I would wear down the charge.  But I do see the benefit of being able to check the time without clicking anything.    The overall huge benefit is that, since I don't use it much, I don't even have to charge it once a day!

"43",43,"Excellent upgrade","This was purchased as a gift for someone upgrading from an iPhone SE so the difference in quality was immediately noticed.

"671",671,"Great phone for a great price","I’m not really good at reviews but here goes. So I had an iPhone 7 until I bought this. I got used to not having a home button in twenty minutes after using this phone. The swiping is so easy and Face ID is amazing. Having two cameras stabilizes the angle of your outward facing photos taken. YouTube reviewers had shown the same images taken with both an XR and 11 and the position of the photo images made the focus more in the middle whereas the XR would change the angle a tiny bit to where certain objects being focused on were angled wrong. Sorry for saying the word angle so much, I’m just not good at describing this stuff. I would recommend you watch all of the YouTube videos comparing the newer iPhone models. This phone has night vision to enable Face ID in the dark. Whereas my 2018 iPad Pro cannot read my face in the dark. I don’t know what else to say, except that you should read every review and watch every review you can to decide on which iPhone is best for you. This phone is the cheapest iPhone that came out in 2019 but that doesn’t mean it’s bad. I love this phone very much. It has a really good battery life and standby time. Much better than my 7 which by the way I had the battery for that phone replaced and restored to 100% battery health a week before buying this and that battery sucks in comparison to this one even with the 100% restore. So yeah I’m happy with my phone. Also I use my phone mainly for music and I can listen with my AirPods all day and my phone will be at 40 something percent when the day is almost over. I know my grammar is bad. I just want people to know that this is a good phone",5,2020-01-24 18:04:00

"675",675,"finally got activated","getting phone bought from best buy activated by verizon was a total pain in the butt.  the Verizon Sim card shipped from best buy had to be replaced with a card from verizon and a hanging out on verizon support chat FOREVER.  

Hopefully the phone works and doesnt get smashed.",2,2019-12-05 22:06:00

"679",679,"Great phone with real all day battery","I upgraded to this phone from an iPhone 6s and it is a huge improvement. On the second battery in my 6s the phone would die after a few hours of moderate use. With the 11 after a full day(12+hours) of moderate to heavy use I have yet to put the battery lower than 35%. I much prefer Face ID over Touch ID and it is almost instantaneous. I compared the screen side by side to the Pro and besides the blacks being slightly blacker the resolution difference is not that apparent to me for everyday use. Cameras and photo processing are excellent. If you like the iPhone ecosystem then this is a great phone.",5,2019-10-18 17:14:00
"680",680,"This phone is a great deal !","You get more bang for your buck with this iPhone than any other model.  It is easy to use and the battery holds a charge for a couple of days.  The new swiping that replaced the home button is actually easier, and I love the face recognition",5,2019-11-18 16:14:00
"681",681,"Hate it","Bought this phone after loving my previous 2 iphones, 6s+ and 8s+. Absolutely HATE it. I bought it the day before leaving the country for 3 weeks and missed the return window. Face ID sucks. Screen is ""larger"" but it feels smaller since my hand is blocking part of it most of the time. Screen was very easily scratched compared to my last 2 iphones they definitely changed something there. Never even needed a protector and a few weeks with this it looks terrible. 

To boot I specifically asked the salesman if I would be able to use the phone overseas since I was flying out the next day and since I was paying for the phone in full he said yes no problem, but Verizon locks ALL devices for 60 days so there's nothing I could do. I was basically without a phone for 3 weeks unless on wifi and still missed the return window. Wish I never bought it.",1,2019-12-30 13:01:00

I selected the wrong set up option the first time around but was able to easily and quickly reset the phone and set it up the way I wanted to.  The best part of setup?

"718",718,"Love the color and the battery life","I've always eyed red version iPhones but I never really liked any of them and XR, while looking the color I wanted, was not the specs I wanted. But with this 11, I was finally able to let go of my iPhone X and move on. The display compared to iPhone X is different, and maybe it's inferior to some people, but to me it doesn't seem inferior as I can do everything I normally do on the phone okay. If you need color accurate phone to do photo or video editing, then it's not the phone you need, but then again, if you need to do it that badly you probably have a tablet or laptop for that.

Also, the battery life has been amazing. I sometimes forget to charge my phone overnight and with the 11, that is ok.

After playing with the phones I was still indecisive. So I spoke to a rep and the best move was going back to Apple! I love Samsung’s note series but I just don’t use all those features. Now I did want the pro max but I just couldn’t see spending so much monthly on the phone. I’ve had this phone for two weeks and the battery is great, camera awesome and it’s fast.

I keep touching the screen with my other fingers and it interferes at times with what I am doing. It is a mi or inconvenience and will not be a problem once I get used to the design. The camera is great, much clearer pictures than I got before. So far, everything is running smooth with the operating system. Looking forward to this phone lasting me awhile.",5,2019-12-20 21:28:00
"734",734,"Worth every penny!","I am a HUGE audiobook fan and have gone thru countless pairs of headphones including several of the “True Wireless” style.
I LOVES the ease of using only headphone with the TWS style and had already bought about 5 pair through the year because each pair would inevitably fall apart months after purchasing - but nonetheless I was committed to finding the perfect pair of TWs headphones! In fact so committed I had developed serious damage to my ears from wearing the ill-fitting contraptions!
After a recent doctor visit, I learned that I had double ear infections on account of those TWS headphones, so I had the green light from the hubs to spend whatever amount just so I’d stop talking about it AND because obviously “I needed them ;)”.

With that background in mind, the sound and fit of these are absolutely right on! Not once have my ears been the slightest bit tender and since wearing them I have regained all the hearing back in both ears I hadn’t realized I had lost until now.

Hey Siri also works how we wished it had for the last 10 years which is to say she basically just worked how she was supppsdd to.’this feature ended up being the one I was most surprised with because I didn’t really have much hope I’d ever use Siri like I do Alexa but I was wrong !",5,2019-11-23 04:55:00
"735",735,"Another Quality Apple Product","Outstanding phone with all the usual iphone features and much improved camera as well as slightly better battery than the XR. 128 gb storage is the sweet spot and should be the starting point for ALL iphones. Screen resolution is better than you'd expect. iOS 13 is a little buggy right now but will get better with updates. If you don't mind paying the Apple tax this is a great product that should meet all your cell phone needs.

"736",736,"Nice phone","The IPhone 11 is a pretty nice phone. I love everything about it except the size. I am used to a smaller size so this is the major thing I have to adjust to. After making a few adjustments now my battery life is wonderful you must shut off the automatic mail push option to manual hey Siri option and background refresh to extend battery life.

Love the fact I can now get 2.5 to 3 days out of the phone before having to recharge and I’m constantly on it for work and play.  My pics are so much better now, even before any editing.

I certainly have much to learn - but I dislike the options of clicking on a person's photo or name to send a message.  Typing in their name and having name recognition is so much faster.",5,2019-12-20 20:21:00

"810",810,"Very happy - switched from Android","I've been very happy with my new iPhone 11.  Was a long time Android user but just switched to be compatible with my kids.  Pleasantly surprised that I like it as much as I do.

Also, no one in sales/support (Verizon, Apple, Best Buy) seemed to know the answers on how seamless the process would be to continue using Google Products (Gmail/Contacts/Calendar) from the Android ecosystem on the iPhone.  Many told me that I could import my data into Apple apps but not maintain both databases concurrently.  I am happy to say that this is WRONG.
  
In the Apple Calendar and Apple Contacts, within app settings, you can set your default calendar/contacts account  to be your Google based accounts.  I also loaded the Google Calendar app so the interface is familiar, but I have it sync to the Apple Calendar app so that I can see calendar events in Apple Car Play and use Siri to make new appointments on the fly.   

Gmail app is fine on Android.  I do not use the Apple Mail app. 

So, I have the best of both Apple and Google worlds!!

Phone is fast, features are wonderful.  Love the face ID for unlock, though it doesn't know me with wet hair and without glasses.  Otherwise it works well.  Battery life is AMAZING!!

"890",890,"Making the change from android...","I've used iOS before, but am coming back to Apple from 4 years of Android. Reason--one word: facetime. It just works so well (at least in my experience). A number of other features are similar considerations. Android is very interesting and can be tweaked, but Apple just works. 

The battery life on the 11 is incredible. With moderate use, you can go at least 2 days between charges. My aging Samsung wasn't even making it a full day. I wonder if that's because of the quick-charge feature.

So far, so good.",5,2019-12-16 11:58:00

"896",896,"Love it","I’m enjoying my new phone however the hype about having the two Cameras is not all that, in my opinion. I will say the photo quality and clarity is outstanding. Perhaps if I

"897",897,"Best apple ever!","Can’t believe I waited so long to upgrade.  The  iPhone 11 is absolutely  awesome.   This is my 3rd iPhone and I’ve never been disappointed.

"898",898,"Great phone and great camera!","I normally take horrible pictures, but no more! The wide lens is amazing! The night mode automatically adjusts the lighting to create a great photo.

"900",900,"Easy to manipulate and move between functions!","I love the size of the 11. I have avoided the larger products because I like to be able to text 1-handed if needed and the smaller screen was adequate for my purposes.

"901",901,"Has great screen quality, the camera is the bom","This is my first time with an apple phone and I Love it. The service and overall quality is the bomb.

"905",905,"Great Phone, but I kinda wish it were smaller","I appreciate the bells and whistles of new iOS and improved battery life as I moved on from iPhone 6, but the new size and weight takes some getting used to. My new holsters make it even more difficult to access my front pants pockets and add even more weight to the phone. That said, everything else about the phone is great--larger capacity--64gb from 16gb = much more music capacity; and it probably is better for my old eyes. I thought I'd miss the Touch ID button, but Face ID actually does work quicker…If I weren't so cheap, I'd probably had gone for the 11 pro!",4,2019-12-13 17:16:00

I bought my phone on release day and just 16 days later it started randomly showing a blank screen with only a apple log and it would do this for hours the first time it did this I was actually downtown New Orleans with my small children and it made it to where we literally ended up completely lost and in the ghetto we couldn't call for help even if we wanted to which put me and my kids lives in danger which isn't acceptable! I also work solely from my phone and because of this I have lost contracts as well as not been able to go to work when bringing this up to an apple supervisor I was told me saying  that this phone has caused huge issues including putting my kids and I in a dangerous situations and putting my lively hood in danger was offensive to her and that maybe I should travel with a map and find a different job and then she Hung up on me!!",1,2019-10-06 20:37:00

Two days later I received an email that my order was cancelled. I lost out",1,2019-12-27 17:48:00
"1177",1177,"Buyer Beware","Multiple hardware and software issues; one of the major issues is echoing and feedback that callers hear on their end when I use speakerphone, facetime or bluetooth.  

Apple replaced it once and the replacement has the same issues.  Several trips to genius bar and multiple phone conversations with tech support just to find out that the replacement needs to replaced.  So this phone is great for pictures, just not for making phone calls!

I've saved money for a year to upgrade to iphone 11 and now I am back to using my 6s. 

Others are having the same issue and more information can be found on apple forums at the link below, however apple doesn't seem to want to address the problem.

In that respect alone, of course, the 11 has proved a great choice.  I did not need the extra bells and whistles of the 11Pro or Max, since I do not take a lot of pictures.  The other greatly expanded features of the 11 (especially compared to my 6!) have proven quite useful, even though I have not explored the whole suite of functions.  Actually, some of the features are a little less than desirable, such as the dropout of volume on certain alerts (?) after the first few seconds, but maybe I just need to read more carefully the settings menus.

Name your new iPhone the exact same Apple ID that on your Apple account page. Or the same ID as your Apple iCloud ID. Then your current Apple computer or iPad and Time Machine, devices, Face Time, the App Store Apple ID, will all be synchronized. Fluid transfer of apps like music, books, Apple TV, podcasts, calendar and more will be interlinked. iPhone's Face ID makes access to keychain simple, fast and secure for website sign-on and banking and Apple pay. The phone allows you to control all aspects of privacy with Siri, advertising, the location from your iPhone settings. So the software and hardware are stable, private and free from third-party intrusion.

Siri can turn any ebook into an audiobook and read the web too.
Dictate text messages amidst background noise with no interference. Delay composing your words and Siri waits without picking up any background noise or turning off.

 The iPhone webpage may be set to reader view with enlarged letters that automatically reformat to your screen for easy reading without manually having to enlarge the print and scroll right and left to read the fine print. 

Apps are quick to download within a second or two. The touchpad is sensitive but not overly sensitive. The only negative is that my 256 GB phone seems to keep apps running in the background, which brings you exactly back where you left off but maybe uses up battery life.

From my experience, the two are almost completely identical, and a normal user won’t even notice the difference. The only drawbacks of the 11 are the lack of that third lens on the camera and the LCD screen vs the OLED. With regard to the telephoto lens, I hardly found myself zooming in far enough to notice not having it. As for the LCD, it is of course a lower resolution than the Pro, and while I do concede that the screen on the Pro is better, it is not a drastic difference. The typical user won’t notice. If you have the money, go for the Pros, otherwise, you’ll be happy with the regular 11.",5,2019-10-18 13:32:00

It has give n me zero problems *thus far*, everything runs so much smoother, cleaner, and without any errors or apps breaking.

My only annoyance now though (and that goes for all technology, I suppose), are the privacy issues that plaque phones and such when we first buy them. Especially when adults don't know what to do or say when being asked for ""their location"", data, etc. 

I just wish the settings for our Privacy always stayed the same when transferring from phone to phone. Otherwise, I feel like certain generations are being as asked a lot of questions when starting up with a new refresher phone. 

So it's not a complicated phone by any means at all. Just a stellar over all beautiful phone in all honesty.",5,2020-01-19 16:05:00

What I like better - 
Face ID is better than finger print ID. I didn’t think I would like it but I do. Low light is sometimes a problem but it usually works.

The screen is bigger even tho the device is smaller overall

The front camera is much better. The back camera is better but I’m no professional So I can’t justify why. 

The battery life seems about the same as when I first got the 7 plus, I can usually get a day and a half to 2 days, which is plenty good to me. 

There’s plenty of other specs that are improved but I’m not sure i take full advantage of them in my regular usage.",5,2019-10-25 13:27:00

"1863",6,"Best iPhone","I originally Purchased the 11 Pro Max. It’s a great phone, but I started noticing it was giving me nasty headache through the day. No matter the brightness. I ended up finding out that since they’re using OLED screen in the 11 pros, it exhibits a phenomenon called PWM. You can research it. Not everyone is effected, but I am. And I had to return it. 

With that out of the way, I can tell you how much I love my 11! It’s got a traditional LCD screen that looks great, and has all of the important stuff the pro’s have. AND it’s cheaper. WAY cheaper. 

Only issue I have is getting used to holding it. I’ve been using iPhone Plus models for years, so going to something more narrow will take some adjusting. 

Otherwise, epic device really.",5,2019-11-30 23:25:00

Which was something I didn’t want to be in the middle of. I felt like a customer that Purchase one of the phones will be caught paying a price later on. Its just my opinion for any one trying to use what Im saying down the line and it just might of been a excuse I made up not to spend that kind of money on a phone. I have changed my mind on the whole I phone view and I’m glad I purchased one but whats even better that I got it from best buy. I always seen and experience best buy to stand behind their product they sell or promote.   So I believe in best buy and know that no matter who made the product they still make it right with you to the best of their knowledge. I mean they are great and helpful especially during the holidays. I purchased a playstation from during Christmas and I thought that since it was a lot of people that I would have to assist my self but that was not the case. Also any time they had to look up something on my account, they where their like if I didn’t have to explain my self to be understood on what I wanted. Thank you Best Buy for your employs and for make my experience with my son some of the best. I guess thats why y'all are called best buy.",5,2020-03-01 05:46:00

"2314",457,"Better qualities compared to past iPhones","On a scale of 1 to 5 (5 is best):
~2 great new cameras- 5
~Much heavier than other phones- 2
~Battery-life improved greatly- 5
~Size of phone (bigger than in the past)- 3
~Speed (how fast things load)-5
~Price-5 (very well priced)
~No home button- 4 (more screen now)

Overall Rating- 4

The iPhone 11 is reasonably priced, has a great battery life, and the speed is faster than ever. With no home button, there is more screen to do the things you love! One downfall, in my opinion, is the size. The iPhone 11 is much larger than the iPhone X. It is also a lot heavier, which can be a burden in your pocket. Other than that, the iPhone 11 is a great choice for a new phone!",4,2019-10-13 22:03:00

Last time I got 256GB and never used even nearly half of the space, so this time I went with 128GB, and it has been plenty of storage for me. The battery lasts much longer than my 7+ ever did. I use my phone for business, and I have not yet once had to plug it in before I go to bed at night, and frequently I don't have to plug it in overnight. Price point is my biggest gripe, but I got it from Best Buy at a discount, so it wasn't as bad as I feared. I definitely recommend the iPhone 11.",5,2020-01-16 12:29:00
"2433",576,"Surprisingly Worthy Upgrade from my iPhone XR","First off, I really loved my XR. I liked the screen size, how powerful the processor was, and the battery life. Contrary to what some people have said, the screen quality on the XR was more than adequate, and my previous phone was the X which has an OLED screen. I even found the camera quality on my XR more than adequate. 

I will say the only substantial difference between the 11 and the XR is the camera. The speaker quality is somewhat clearer with more depth than the XR, but the speakers on the XR are really good and the difference is minor at best. The same is also true for the battery life. The battery life on the XR is great with the 11 slightly greater (with both phones it's unusual for me to have less than 50% battery life at the end of a long day).

Having said all of this, the new cameras are so good it's worth the upgrade from the XR to the 11. I love the night mode and the ultra wide lens. I'm able to take any number of photos I really couldn't take on any iPhone before. But beyond that, the video quality and still life quality on the standard wide lens is the biggest jump I've seen in any iPhone since the iPhone 6 came out. This isn't the sort of upgrade anyone with an iPhone 8 or maybe even iPhone 7 needs, but it's nevertheless a terrific upgrade I am happy I made.",5,2019-11-23 00:20:00

"2438",581,"Signal Reception Earns iPhone 11 1 Star","iOS is beautiful, as always. I've used iPhones for years now. 

The signal reception is an absolute joke ever since they switched to Intel. Granted, I do live in the country, but my Galaxy s10e has none of the same signal issues here. VoLTE on the iPhone 11 simply doesn't work unless you're in a super strong signal area, and the signal continuously drops in and out at my house. The amsung Galaxy s10e gets full bars and I have zero trouble talking over VoLTE, at the same location. 

I'll be returning this and keeping my iPhone 8 Plus until Apple decides to use Qualcomm instead of Intel.",1,2019-09-29 12:49:00
"2439",582,"Great phone upgrade","I finally gave up on my iPhone SE after the battery started playing out and being product shamed for having such an old version (is that the first iPhone ever??).  The iPhone 11 is a beautiful phone with a long lasting battery and great camera.  My only con is the size - it is significantly larger that my old one and it appears to be very fragile.  My fear is it falling out of a shallow pocket (don't want to add a case due to its size), so I got roped into the Apple Care.  I also like the 128K to store music and photos.  In spite of the size adjustment, I'm very satisfied with the product.",5,2020-01-24 16:24:00
"2440",583,"A great phone upgrade","My wife isn’t really worried about how up to date her tech is, but she’s soooo glad she upgraded from her iPhone 6S to iPhone 11. She loves the full screen and said she got used to not having a home button with a day or two. The camera is great and overall such a nice phone. She was not a fan of the fingerprint ID so changing over to face recognition is something she loves. And nice to have an option that was less expensive as the Pro options.

(It replaced her 5C.) She is not tech inclined, so I was concerned about her getting a new phone with a new IOS and without a home button. However, she hasn't asked me to help her very much at all because the interface is so user friendly. I think you'll be happy with this phone even if you don't like ""gadgets.""",5,2020-01-16 12:35:00

I want to be able to study the face of the phone without it opening up.  Touch ID is what I really miss. I asked about it specifically and was told it would work.

I would certainly recommend this phone to someone looking to upgrade.  The Apple ecosystem is excellent!

We had this picked up at Best Buy, and they also helped with the setup of the new phone.  The staff were great and very helpful.
