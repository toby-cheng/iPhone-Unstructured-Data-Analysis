All I can say apple makes a great phone experience 
I’m hooked and will never go back to Samsung",5,2019-12-27 22:07:00

"3","Great Value","Besides the beautiful color, there's a significant memory increase and better battery life. Camera is much clearer. Love the instore pickup from best buy. Body of phone seems much sturdy than my XR which  kinda felt a little plastic now compared to the 11. Only took an hour to get my new phone.  Spent only about 3 minutes in store. Will be ordering all my phones from here for now on.",5,2019-12-28 10:05:00

"5","My daughter loves it!","We love the camera on the iPhone 11, it takes great pics.",5,2019-12-27 17:33:00
"6","Best iPhone","I originally Purchased the 11 Pro Max. It’s a great phone, but I started noticing it was giving me nasty headache through the day. No matter the brightness. I ended up finding out that since they’re using OLED screen in the 11 pros, it exhibits a phenomenon called PWM. You can research it. Not everyone is effected, but I am. And I had to return it. 

With that out of the way, I can tell you how much I love my 11! It’s got a traditional LCD screen that looks great, and has all of the important stuff the pro’s have. AND it’s cheaper. WAY cheaper. 

Only issue I have is getting used to holding it. I’ve been using iPhone Plus models for years, so going to something more narrow will take some adjusting. 

Otherwise, epic device really.",5,2019-11-30 23:25:00
"7","I phone 11 review","I have to say that i was a android man and was not found of I phones, ever since i heard of them getting sued for there phones. Which was something I didn’t want to be in the middle of. I felt like a customer that Purchase one of the phones will be caught paying a price later on. Its just my opinion for any one trying to use what Im saying down the line and it just might of been a excuse I made up not to spend that kind of money on a phone. I have changed my mind on the whole I phone view and I’m glad I purchased one but whats even better that I got it from best buy. I always seen and experience best buy to stand behind their product they sell or promote.   So I believe in best buy and know that no matter who made the product they still make it right with you to the best of their knowledge. I mean they are great and helpful especially during the holidays. I purchased a playstation from during Christmas and I thought that since it was a lot of people that I would have to assist my self but that was not the case. Also any time they had to look up something on my account, they where their like if I didn’t have to explain my self to be understood on what I wanted. Thank you Best Buy for your employs and for make my experience with my son some of the best. I guess thats why y'all are called best buy.",5,2020-03-01 05:46:00

"10","Great phone, super fast, wonderful camera!","I had been crawling along with a iphone 6 for a number of years.  I finally bit the bullet and upgraded to an iphone 11.  WOW!  The difference between a 6 and 11 is profound!!  This phone is so fast!  And I thought the facial recognition was just a fad feature, but it makes getting into and using the phone so much easier!  The only thing that prevents this from being a 5-star rating is the cost.  Alas, iphones are expensive!  No getting around that!",4,2020-02-28 15:52:00
"11","Great upgrade","Upgraded from and iPhone 6 and it feels like a massive upgrade. If you’re reading this then you probably figure you can get more info from Apple’s website directly.

Thanks, Teddy and Cat!!!",5,2019-10-11 16:08:00
"17","Good snug fit leather case for iPhone 11","The case snaps fit easily without having to struggle to put the phone in or pop it out. The leather texture feels soft yet sturdy enough for the phone, and gives a hard shell covering around the bezel. What I liked is a small pocket at the back of the cover where you can slide in two credit cards - at least.",5,2020-01-03 16:04:00

"24","Amazing upgrade","This is the upgrade to my wife's 6Plus. She absolutely loves the red color and added a clear glitter case to go with it. Her biggest complaint about the 6Plus was the overall size of the phone, but this 11 solves that issue. This 11 has a larger screen yet an overall smaller footprint. Now her phone fits in the designated phone space in her purse and fits pockets way better. Plus the speed and screen resolution is amazing.",5,2019-10-26 05:12:00

"457","Better qualities compared to past iPhones","On a scale of 1 to 5 (5 is best):
~2 great new cameras- 5
~Much heavier than other phones- 2
~Battery-life improved greatly- 5
~Size of phone (bigger than in the past)- 3
~Speed (how fast things load)-5
~Price-5 (very well priced)
~No home button- 4 (more screen now)

Overall Rating- 4

The iPhone 11 is reasonably priced, has a great battery life, and the speed is faster than ever. With no home button, there is more screen to do the things you love! One downfall, in my opinion, is the size. The iPhone 11 is much larger than the iPhone X. It is also a lot heavier, which can be a burden in your pocket. Other than that, the iPhone 11 is a great choice for a new phone!",4,2019-10-13 22:03:00

My local ""Best Buy"" in Myrtle Beach would not sell me the phone. The sales woman said she could lose her job if she allowed the sale for a phone that was not for the individual. (The phone was purchased and not paid for in installments) Ordered it from Best Buy online. And guess what. Was three days late. The phone was supposed to be a Birthday gift. Really crappy service.

First, the screen scratches extremely easy with nothing done to it other than normal use. My iPhone 6 had less scratches after 5 years than the iPhone 11 after 5days. Screen protector is a must! Also, it’s extremely slippery, almost like they coated it with a substance. Not having a home button or finger print scanner is abysmal.

"575","Apple Continues to Impress","Even though this isn't the Pro model with the ""best"" camera, the camera is still fantastic! (We used my phone for all of our Christmas photos this year.) I was a bit skeptic about not having a home button when I upgraded from a 7+, but I have been pleasantly surprised at how easy and intuitive the interface is... again! Last time I got 256GB and never used even nearly half of the space, so this time I went with 128GB, and it has been plenty of storage for me. The battery lasts much longer than my 7+ ever did. I use my phone for business, and I have not yet once had to plug it in before I go to bed at night, and frequently I don't have to plug it in overnight. Price point is my biggest gripe, but I got it from Best Buy at a discount, so it wasn't as bad as I feared. I definitely recommend the iPhone 11.",5,2020-01-16 12:29:00
"576","Surprisingly Worthy Upgrade from my iPhone XR","First off, I really loved my XR. I liked the screen size, how powerful the processor was, and the battery life. Contrary to what some people have said, the screen quality on the XR was more than adequate, and my previous phone was the X which has an OLED screen. I even found the camera quality on my XR more than adequate. 

I will say the only substantial difference between the 11 and the XR is the camera. The speaker quality is somewhat clearer with more depth than the XR, but the speakers on the XR are really good and the difference is minor at best. The same is also true for the battery life. The battery life on the XR is great with the 11 slightly greater (with both phones it's unusual for me to have less than 50% battery life at the end of a long day).

Having said all of this, the new cameras are so good it's worth the upgrade from the XR to the 11. I love the night mode and the ultra wide lens. I'm able to take any number of photos I really couldn't take on any iPhone before. But beyond that, the video quality and still life quality on the standard wide lens is the biggest jump I've seen in any iPhone since the iPhone 6 came out. This isn't the sort of upgrade anyone with an iPhone 8 or maybe even iPhone 7 needs, but it's nevertheless a terrific upgrade I am happy I made.",5,2019-11-23 00:20:00

"581","Signal Reception Earns iPhone 11 1 Star","iOS is beautiful, as always. I've used iPhones for years now. 

The signal reception is an absolute joke ever since they switched to Intel. Granted, I do live in the country, but my Galaxy s10e has none of the same signal issues here. VoLTE on the iPhone 11 simply doesn't work unless you're in a super strong signal area, and the signal continuously drops in and out at my house. The amsung Galaxy s10e gets full bars and I have zero trouble talking over VoLTE, at the same location. 

I'll be returning this and keeping my iPhone 8 Plus until Apple decides to use Qualcomm instead of Intel.",1,2019-09-29 12:49:00
"582","Great phone upgrade","I finally gave up on my iPhone SE after the battery started playing out and being product shamed for having such an old version (is that the first iPhone ever??).  The iPhone 11 is a beautiful phone with a long lasting battery and great camera.  My only con is the size - it is significantly larger that my old one and it appears to be very fragile.  My fear is it falling out of a shallow pocket (don't want to add a case due to its size), so I got roped into the Apple Care.  I also like the 128K to store music and photos.  In spite of the size adjustment, I'm very satisfied with the product.",5,2020-01-24 16:24:00
"583","A great phone upgrade","My wife isn’t really worried about how up to date her tech is, but she’s soooo glad she upgraded from her iPhone 6S to iPhone 11. She loves the full screen and said she got used to not having a home button with a day or two. The camera is great and overall such a nice phone. She was not a fan of the fingerprint ID so changing over to face recognition is something she loves. And nice to have an option that was less expensive as the Pro options. When we bought iPhone 11, Best Buy has a sale where it was basically the same as an XR.",5,2020-01-31 14:53:00

(It replaced her 5C.) She is not tech inclined, so I was concerned about her getting a new phone with a new IOS and without a home button. However, she hasn't asked me to help her very much at all because the interface is so user friendly. I think you'll be happy with this phone even if you don't like ""gadgets.""",5,2020-01-16 12:35:00

That’s huge because I used it for all my frequently used apps.  2) Screen does not rotate when locked. I could sign in from any direction on my old phone.  3) Facial recognition to sign in. I want to be able to study the face of the phone without it opening up.  Touch ID is what I really miss. I asked about it specifically and was told it would work.  The other two are just annoyances and the rest of the phone is great. I love the color choices too.

"660","Best iPhone Priced Right","I debated about getting the Pro but am very happy I went with just the iPhone !!. The only advantage with the Pro was the camera specs and being a professional photographer, the advantage wasn't worth the price. The iPhone has all the bells and whistles and is very fast with the apps I run. The upgrade from iPhone 7 to 11 was worth it although the re-learning curve is a hard due to the fact of no physical HOME button. But I really do not miss it.",5,2020-01-03 18:49:00

For the camera, we haven'y had a chance to test it out too much, but they do seem very good.  The speed of the camera is noticeable, which is nice.  

I would certainly recommend this phone to someone looking to upgrade.  The Apple ecosystem is excellent!

We had this picked up at Best Buy, and they also helped with the setup of the new phone.  The staff were great and very helpful.  We did have a little wait and it seems there were some delays with iCloud that caused some small issues.  Overall, great product and experience with the Best Buy team!",5,2019-09-27 15:21:00
