"1","Love it!","I’ve had it for 2 days, but easy adjustment. I like that it’s slightly bigger, yet not too big. Love the night mode on the camera and the new purple color (although I wish it was a little darker). I also Really Love that there’s an option to have numbers that are Not in your contacts, that you’re not familiar with Not Ring At All. They will go straight to voicemail. If they leave a message you can decide if it’s important or not! Especially great for my mother who was Scammed out of money!",5,2019-09-23 00:16:00
"2","Amazing phone","I had a iPhone 8 that was messed up & had to get a new phone. Getting this phone was the best thing I’ve bought for myself. I’ve dropped it multiple times & it still hasn’t cracked or gotten scratched!",5,2020-01-15 21:32:00
"3","All around the best most fun phone ever","When I got it I was so excited to open the package I could hardly wait, i got it open and sure enough the phone was beautiful, then I went to activate it and it is absolutely amazing, I love it",5,2019-12-28 20:09:00
"4","Easy to use ! Takes great pictures","Phone is easy to use . Has several colors to pick from . The camera is great .",5,2019-09-27 16:10:00
"5","Very happy with the look, pics, & ease of use!","Very satisfied that I bought 3 of them and so happy with both the 11 and 11 Pro !! Amazing the pictures, look, feel, and speed!",5,2019-10-04 20:23:00
"6","Long lasting battery and amazing camera","The battery lasts for sooo long! I’ll wake up at around 6, and not have to charge it till around 4:00. The screen is a perfect size, and fingerprints don’t show up much on it. The camera quality is insane and shows tons of detail. The pictures i’ll provide just show how great the quality is. I would 100% recommend this phone.",5,2019-11-17 13:53:00
"7","New iPhone 11!!! What else is there to say!?","THIS! I was adment I didn’t need a new phone and I was also going to go with the X-RAY but after having gotten a good deal on this phone with Sprint I think I can very much say I’m glad I went the route of going for the newest iPhone. It makes a world of difference especially when I test the in-store XR models and can just feel the differences when I use the phone for a variety of apps and so on.",5,2019-12-19 11:09:00
"8","iPhone 11 is Top Notch","When my sister first visited me about a suggestion to purchase my first iPhone 6S about 2-1/2 yrs ago, I was nervous, having been used to a simple LG phone with a pull-out keyboard for nearly 8 yrs.   My New 2-wk-old iPhone 11 is again a beauty of a phone. The (PRODUCT)RED style has a sweet spot in my life, I appreciate Best Buy providing the iPhone and secondly, helping me to do set-up. Thank you Best Buy.",5,2020-02-29 19:23:00
"9","Keeping up with Apple","I haven’t had this phone long enough to give it an in depth review but my initial thoughts are that it’s pretty similar to my iPhone 7 Plus. The phone seems to be a little faster than my iPhone 7. I love the facial recognition feature which basically makes the phone seem to be ready to use as soon as you pick it up. I haven’t had a chance to use the camera much but it takes great pictures as did my iPhone 7 Plus.",5,2019-10-05 08:34:00
"10","Love it’s ease of use","Easy to use once I got used to not having a home button",5,2019-11-08 19:38:00
"11","Love this phone","I switched from Note8 to iPhone11. I preordered, so was really hoping it’d be something I’d be happy with. Everything went great until I tried to connect Bluetooth. It wouldn’t connect to my car or 2 wireless earbuds. I tried at least 100x lol. I came back to Best Buy and the guy entered the numbers from my phone’s box (into his computer) then all of the sudden my Bluetooth worked flawlessly. Although, it was very strange and I was never told what they had done, my iPhone now works with Bluetooth perfectly. No other issues at all!",5,2019-10-14 01:02:00
"12","Great Quality","iPhones should come with a case, but until that time, buy one fro Tech21.  This case is subtle, gender neutral, not too bulky with great protection.  Might be able to find it Online or price match it for a better deal.",5,2020-02-29 17:11:00
"13","Lovin it so far","Loving it so far.  My only complaints are in the sound department.  I have a harder time hearing on this Iphone than my 7.  It seems you have to hold it in just the right spot.  The other complaint I have is when someone calls you, the volume startsloud and then softens, making it hard to hear at times.",5,2019-12-07 07:34:00
"14","iPhone 11 is WOW","I bought this for my mother. She is 75 and has trouble with some technology. She has had iPhones in the past and was still skeptical if she could figure it out. She loves it. No problems at all.",5,2020-02-20 21:47:00
"15","My son loves this phone","A generous upgrade in all areas from iPhone 7. The camera, battery and processor all contribute to this phones value. This was an easy decision once our lease was up, keeping payments very similar.",5,2020-02-18 07:48:00
"16","iPhone 11 128GB","Bought this as a Christmas present for my daughter.  To say she loves it would be an understatement!  The overall size of the phone is smaller than her 8 Plus she previously had and she loves that.  Extremely happy with this purchase so far!",5,2020-01-27 11:13:00
"17","Great camera!","Love the camera on my new iPhone 11 
Switched from Samsung after 10 years  happy with iPhone 11
Battery last much longer 
Very happy I made the switch",5,2020-02-29 08:47:00
"18","Love the extra memory","I upgraded from a iPhone 6+ with 16 gigabyte to the iPhone 11 with 128 gigabytes.  Love the extra memory for apps, photos, and videos. Great camera.",5,2020-02-29 03:17:00
"19","Great Phone","1st time using a Apple phone. After playing with it, I must say it's a good phone. The speakers are far some of the best ones that I have heard. Still playing with it but it's not my daily phone.",5,2020-02-08 16:48:00
"20","Good value for the money","I bought the 11 to replace my iPhone 6, which was using up battery life too soon and too frequently.  In that respect alone, of course, the 11 has proved a great choice.  I did not need the extra bells and whistles of the 11Pro or Max, since I do not take a lot of pictures.  The other greatly expanded features of the 11 (especially compared to my 6!) have proven quite useful, even though I have not explored the whole suite of functions.  Actually, some of the features are a little less than desirable, such as the dropout of volume on certain alerts (?) after the first few seconds, but maybe I just need to read more carefully the settings menus.  I was also quite pleased at the price.",4,2019-11-15 13:50:00
"21","Great Upgrade from iPhone 6s","This has been a great upgrade from the iPhone 6s I had.  The staff easily and quickly got me up and rolling converting everything over from my old phone.  This larger screen has been great and the larger size hasn't been a nuisance (being a guy I was a tad worried).  I don't know that I needed the 3rd camera as a 2x optical isn't really much.  The camera on this one is awesome and I've had a blast using it!",5,2019-11-01 15:39:00
"22","Great upgrade","Decided to upgrade from an iPhone7 due to BestBuy offering the iPhone11 for $500. Defintely a better phone but also has a bit of a learning curve. Still getting used to the lack of a home button and have had to google some simple things, i.e., how to turn the phone off. Even with the learning curve, I'm happy with the purchase.",5,2019-11-30 19:12:00
"23","Convert","Converting from years of being an Android person makes it a bit tough. I knew it’d have it’s challenges going in. My daughter is a devout Apple-er, so she helps. We’re actually closer now. Unforeseen benefits! The selection of emojis and animated cartoons makes things more fun!",5,2019-12-20 17:11:00

"25","Good phone!","I was looking at an 11pro max, but this was free for joining sprint.  Really hard to pass up free!  I had a 7 plus, and I don’t notice the size difference.  The wife had the 11 pro max and I can hardly tell the difference there either.",5,2020-01-03 15:56:00
"26","Great phone.  Just what I needed plus accessories.","Came in to get a new phone, but not sure what I needed.  Then the salesman turned into a consultant, led me to exactly what I need, and advised me on the size of memory and various protection items.  Could not have done it without the Best Buy rep.",5,2019-12-27 17:30:00
"27","The only phone that I wanted to buy","Been waiting for a good deal in order to get the iphone11 and finally Best Buy had a good promotion going. I like how the phone fits in my hand. I previously had the iphone 7 so this was quite the upgrade for me.",5,2020-01-10 15:38:00
"28","It is a very good smart phone for a beginner.","This is my first smart phone. I was thinking about getting last year’s XR. Now I got this iPhone 11 with cheaper price . I am pretty happy with it. After I got it last month, I did go to Apple store for a class. There are so much to learn though. Since I already retired, I will spend more time for Apple classes. Thx.

"349","Keep Android lose privacy. Apple intuitive private","Your 'account for everything apple' is found at https://appleid.apple.com/#!&page=signin
Name your new iPhone the exact same Apple ID that on your Apple account page. Or the same ID as your Apple iCloud ID. Then your current Apple computer or iPad and Time Machine, devices, Face Time, the App Store Apple ID, will all be synchronized. Fluid transfer of apps like music, books, Apple TV, podcasts, calendar and more will be interlinked. iPhone's Face ID makes access to keychain simple, fast and secure for website sign-on and banking and Apple pay. The phone allows you to control all aspects of privacy with Siri, advertising, the location from your iPhone settings. So the software and hardware are stable, private and free from third-party intrusion.

Siri can turn any ebook into an audiobook and read the web too.
Dictate text messages amidst background noise with no interference. Delay composing your words and Siri waits without picking up any background noise or turning off.

 The iPhone webpage may be set to reader view with enlarged letters that automatically reformat to your screen for easy reading without manually having to enlarge the print and scroll right and left to read the fine print. 

Apps are quick to download within a second or two. The touchpad is sensitive but not overly sensitive. The only negative is that my 256 GB phone seems to keep apps running in the background, which brings you exactly back where you left off but maybe uses up battery life. So I need to look into how to conserve battery usage. Perhaps by clicking on low battery usage.",4,2019-10-15 15:28:00

The red color is AWESOME & notice a huge difference in the picture quality. Still trying to figure out which way is “up” with no Home button, but love to just swipe to turn it on!   The best part was the trade-in for free & after 2 years (with no monthly payment), the phone is mine!  Great promotion people...take advantage of it!!!

"355","Everything the 11 Pro offers, but cheaper","I’m upgrading from an iPhone 7, and It’s been a delightful experience. My girlfriend has the iPhone 11 Pro, and so I’ve been able to use both. From my experience, the two are almost completely identical, and a normal user won’t even notice the difference. The only drawbacks of the 11 are the lack of that third lens on the camera and the LCD screen vs the OLED. With regard to the telephoto lens, I hardly found myself zooming in far enough to notice not having it. As for the LCD, it is of course a lower resolution than the Pro, and while I do concede that the screen on the Pro is better, it is not a drastic difference. The typical user won’t notice. If you have the money, go for the Pros, otherwise, you’ll be happy with the regular 11.",5,2019-10-18 13:32:00

The greatest bonus here is the dual cameras including widescreen and it is easily in the top 3 phone cameras on the market.

"370","The best iphone to date","Of all of the iphones, the 11 is truly worth the wait, worth your money, and just an over all stellar phone.

It has give n me zero problems *thus far*, everything runs so much smoother, cleaner, and without any errors or apps breaking.

My only annoyance now though (and that goes for all technology, I suppose), are the privacy issues that plaque phones and such when we first buy them. Especially when adults don't know what to do or say when being asked for ""their location"", data, etc. 

I just wish the settings for our Privacy always stayed the same when transferring from phone to phone. Otherwise, I feel like certain generations are being as asked a lot of questions when starting up with a new refresher phone. 

So it's not a complicated phone by any means at all. Just a stellar over all beautiful phone in all honesty.",5,2020-01-19 16:05:00

"373","Pretty good, could be better","I like the camera and photo options. Takes 3D photos.  But there have been some glitches and ease of use could improve as well. Overall I’d knock another $200 off the price to make it a good phone for the price. (slightly overpriced in my opinion). And the battery is a little bit small and runs out of juice quicker than my 6s battery did. So that’s not cool. Overall a pretty good phone. Granted I’ve only had it for a week.",4,2019-12-06 16:30:00
"374","Beautiful Color","Wasn't planning on getting the new iPhone this year until I saw the trade-in offer and the $100 discount for purchasing the phone unlocked.

"395","Nice upgrade. Reasonable price","I upgrade my iPhone 7 Plus to the new iPhone 11. 

What I like better - 
Face ID is better than finger print ID. I didn’t think I would like it but I do. Low light is sometimes a problem but it usually works.

The screen is bigger even tho the device is smaller overall

The front camera is much better. The back camera is better but I’m no professional So I can’t justify why. 

The battery life seems about the same as when I first got the 7 plus, I can usually get a day and a half to 2 days, which is plenty good to me. 

There’s plenty of other specs that are improved but I’m not sure i take full advantage of them in my regular usage.",5,2019-10-25 13:27:00
